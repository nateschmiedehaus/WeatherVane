**Assumptions**
- Policy controller parity is required before next release.
- Router is locked to Codex5/Claude4.x models.
**Open Questions**

- How do we surface controller decisions in context packs?
- What telemetry proves the parity in GitHub Checks?
**Proposed Spikes**
- Spike branch to mock Github policy events and verify end-to-end logging.
