# Governance Snapshot

- Reframe state triggers when misalignment detectors fire (looping verify failures, spec drift, dependency thrash, external blocks).
- Navigator Council (Planner + Thinker + Reviewer + Critical) drafts RFC with alternatives, risks, and acceptance impacts.
- ADRs stored under `docs/autopilot/ADR/` (create on demand) and referenced from Component Cards + manifest.
- Cool-downs: ≤2 task-level reframes / 24h, ≤1 story/epic pivot per sprint unless manual override recorded.
- Every pivot requires evidence pack + shadow-plan dry-run artifacts linked in the decision journal.
