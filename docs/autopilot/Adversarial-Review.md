# Adversarial Review Framework

**Readability** — Would I understand this in 6 months? Could a junior explain it in 2 minutes?  
**Maintainability** — What breaks if requirements change? Hidden coupling?  
**Performance** — What happens with 10k items? Worst‑case complexity?  
**Security** — How would I exploit this? Secrets/PII protected?  
**Error Handling** — API/filesystem/network fail paths actionable?  
**Testing** — Behavior not internals? Catch realistic regressions?  
**Meta** — Fixing the right problem? Over‑engineering? Measured before optimizing?
