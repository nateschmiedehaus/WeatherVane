## Critical Issues

- **Scope vs reality gap exceeds 50%**
  - Impact: 0/11 tasks complete → 100% gap
  - Recommendation: Reduce scope or increase delivery capacity before planning additional features.
  - Related: T13.1.1, T13.1.2, T13.1.3, T13.1.4, T13.2.1, T13.2.2, T13.2.3, T13.3.1, T13.3.2, T13.4.1, T13.4.2

- **MMM pipeline still uses heuristic covariance fit instead of LightweightMMM.**
  - Impact: /Volumes/BigSSD4/nathanielschmiedehaus/Documents/WeatherVane/apps/model/pipelines/poc_models.py calls fit_mmm_model() but never invokes fit_lightweight_mmm().
  - Recommendation: Wire apps/model/mmm_lightweight.py into train_poc_models so adstock + saturation estimates feed allocations.
  - Related: T13.2.1

- **MMM implementation lacks adstock or saturation transforms.**
  - Impact: /Volumes/BigSSD4/nathanielschmiedehaus/Documents/WeatherVane/apps/model/mmm.py has no mention of adstock or saturation functions.
  - Recommendation: Adopt geometric adstock and Hill saturation before exposing channel elasticities.
  - Related: T13.2.1

- **Causal uplift model still fits propensity scores for weather treatment.**
  - Impact: /Volumes/BigSSD4/nathanielschmiedehaus/Documents/WeatherVane/apps/model/causal_uplift.py:15 imports LogisticRegression for propensity estimation.
  - Recommendation: Replace with Difference-in-Differences or synthetic control to handle non-manipulable weather shocks.
  - Related: T13.3.1

- **No MMM backtesting suite found.**
  - Impact: Expected tests/modeling/test_mmm_backtests.py does not exist.
  - Recommendation: Add a rolling backtest harness to exercise MMM across historical windows and guard regressions.
  - Related: T13.2.2

## High Priority Issues

- **Foundational work 'Autopilot guardrail for ingestion + weather drift' still incomplete**
  - Impact: Foundational capabilities should precede advanced modeling.
  - Recommendation: Prioritise T13.1.2 before downstream modeling tasks.
  - Related: T13.1.2

- **Foundational work 'Implement product taxonomy auto-classification with weather affinity' still incomplete**
  - Impact: Foundational capabilities should precede advanced modeling.
  - Recommendation: Prioritise T13.1.3 before downstream modeling tasks.
  - Related: T13.1.3

- **Foundational work 'Data quality validation framework (verify data fitness for ML)' still incomplete**
  - Impact: Foundational capabilities should precede advanced modeling.
  - Recommendation: Prioritise T13.1.4 before downstream modeling tasks.
  - Related: T13.1.4

- **Foundational work 'Build MMM backtesting + regression suite' still incomplete**
  - Impact: Foundational capabilities should precede advanced modeling.
  - Recommendation: Prioritise T13.2.2 before downstream modeling tasks.
  - Related: T13.2.2

## Additional Warnings

- **No DMA/geography mapping utilities detected in shared libraries.**
  - Impact: Searched shared/**/ for *dma*.py but found none.
  - Recommendation: Introduce a DMA-first geography mapper so feature builders and allocators align with documented hierarchy.
  - Related: T13.3.2

- **docs/MODELING_REALITY_CHECK.md still states geographic decisions are unresolved.**
  - Impact: Document contains the prompt 'Need to answer these questions'.
  - Recommendation: Update the doc once DMA hierarchy is implemented to record the final decision and thresholds.
  - Related: T13.3.2

## Status Breakdown

- Done: 0

## Next Steps

- Address critical issues before claiming epic completion.
- Re-run meta-critique after blockers are resolved.
