## Integration Points

**How tasks integrate:**
- [Integration point 1]
- [Integration point 2]
- [Integration point 3]

**Shared components:**
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]

## PLAN-authored Tests

**Tests designed before implementation:**

### Test 1: [Test Name]
**What it tests:** [Functionality being tested]
**Method:** [How to run the test]
**Success criteria:** [What passing looks like]

### Test 2: [Test Name]
**What it tests:** [Functionality being tested]
**Method:** [How to run the test]
**Success criteria:** [What passing looks like]

### Test 3: [Test Name]
**What it tests:** [Functionality being tested]
**Method:** [How to run the test]
**Success criteria:** [What passing looks like]

[Add more as needed]

**Note:** These tests must exist before IMPLEMENT phase. Tests may be failing/skipped initially, but they must be authored.

## Via Negativa Analysis

**What can we DELETE/SIMPLIFY?**
- Option 1: [What could be removed] - [Impact if removed]
- Option 2: [What could be simplified] - [Impact if simplified]
- **Selected:** [What we're actually deleting/simplifying]

**Justification for additions:** [Why new code/complexity is necessary]

---

## Refactor vs Repair

**Are we fixing root cause or patching symptoms?**
- **Symptom:** [The visible problem]
- **Root cause:** [The underlying issue]
- **Approach:** [Root cause refactor] vs [Symptom patch]
- **Justification:** [Why this approach addresses the root cause]

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: [Risk Name]
**Mitigation:** [How we'll handle this]

### Risk 2: [Risk Name]
**Mitigation:** [How we'll handle this]

## Files and LOC Estimate

**Total estimates:**
- **Files affected:** ~[N] files
- **Net LOC:** ~[N] LOC
- **Duration:** ~[N] hours/days

**Within limits?**
- Task limit: ≤5 files, ≤150 LOC per task
- Set limit: Reasonable scope for coherent work unit
