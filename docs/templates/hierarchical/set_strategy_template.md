# STRATEGY: [set-id]

**Set:** [set-id] | **Milestone:** [MILESTONE-ID] | **Epic:** [EPIC-ID]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Problem

**What problem does this set of tasks solve?**

[Describe the specific problem this set addresses. Keep focused - sets are narrower than epics. Include:]
- The specific gap or pain point
- Why grouping these tasks together makes sense
- How this set contributes to the milestone/epic goals

**Current state:**
- [Current pain point 1]
- [Current pain point 2]
- [Current pain point 3]

---

## Goal

**What's the desired outcome after completing this set?**

[One clear paragraph describing the end state after all tasks in this set are complete]

**Specific improvements:**
- [Improvement 1 - be concrete and measurable]
- [Improvement 2 - be concrete and measurable]
- [Improvement 3 - be concrete and measurable]

---

## Rationale for Clustering

**Why are these tasks grouped together?**

[Explain why these specific tasks belong in the same set. Common reasons:]
- **Shared pattern/architecture:** All tasks touch the same component/system
- **Sequential dependency:** Tasks must be done in order
- **Skill/domain affinity:** All require similar expertise
- **Integration point:** All integrate with the same interface
- **Learning opportunity:** Completing together builds coherent understanding

**Task relationships:**
```
[Task 1] → [Task 2] → [Task 3]
     ↓          ↓          ↓
[Shared foundation/pattern/system]
```
