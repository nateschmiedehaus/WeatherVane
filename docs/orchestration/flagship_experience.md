# Flagship Experience Charter

WeatherVane aspires to be the most compelling weather-first marketing experience on the web. This charter codifies the standards every roadmap slice must meet.

## Creative North Star
- **Atmosphere** — Fuse real-time weather data with cinematic storytelling. Palettes adapt instantly, typography breathes with conditions, and motion mirrors atmospheric physics.
- **Narrative** — Every flow should read like an executive storyboard: awareness, onboarding, scenario building, execution, and follow-up.
- **Conversion** — The flagship demo must deliver value in minutes and guide prospects to a confident “pay now” moment.

## Reference Gallery
- Framer — `state/web_inspiration/atlas_sprint` for hero kinetic pacing and motion language.
- Webflow — `state/web_inspiration/demo_polish` for responsive fluidity and conversion framing.
- Awwwards / SiteInspire — `state/web_inspiration/dana_review` for color theory, typography, and interaction cue discipline.

## Critic Alignment
- ExperienceFlowCritic ensures journeys and demo choreography remain orchestrated.
- WeatherAestheticCritic maintains ambient theming across weather states.
- MotionDesignCritic and ResponsiveSurfaceCritic validate kinetic craft and device polish.
- InspirationCoverageCritic checks that research insights turn into execution.
- StakeholderNarrativeCritic and DemoConversionCritic keep revenue storytelling sharp.
- IntegrationCompletenessCritic guarantees APIs, data, and payments stay resilient.

## Expectations for Every Slice
1. Refresh the relevant artifacts under `state/artifacts/**`.
2. Link live prototypes, screenshots, and performance captures.
3. Document stakeholder-ready narratives and conversion playbooks.
4. Run the full critic matrix; treat failures as blockers until resolved or escalated.
5. Capture lessons in `state/context.md` so the knowledge compounds.

Deliver something breathtaking every iteration—beautiful, brilliant, and unquestionably ready for prime time.
