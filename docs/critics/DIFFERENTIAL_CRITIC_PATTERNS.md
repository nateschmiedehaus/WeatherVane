# Differential Critic Patterns - Domain-Specific Verification

See full document in repository.

**Key Pattern:** Match verification method to knowledge domain:
- **UX/Design** → Vision analysis (screenshots)
- **Data/ML** → Statistical validation
- **Backend/API** → Runtime testing  
- **Database** → Query profiling
- **Security** → Vulnerability scanning
- **Performance** → Benchmarking
- **Infrastructure** → Chaos testing

**Philosophy:** The best verification mimics real-world usage.
