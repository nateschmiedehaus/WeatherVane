## Intro (0:00-0:30)

**[VISUAL: WeatherVane dashboard with live weather overlay]**

"Hi, I'm [name], and I want to show you something that's costing your brand money right now.

Last winter, we analyzed a seasonal apparel brand. They had a warm February. Traditional ad models predicted $2.3M in revenue. They spent their full budget. Final result? $1.8M. That's a $500K miss—simply because their models didn't know about weather.

This is WeatherVane. We solve that problem."

## The Problem (0:30-1:15)

**[VISUAL: Dashboard showing "No Weather Awareness" mode with basic metrics]**

"Here's what most brands do today: They treat all days equally. Same daily ad budget regardless of weather.

Watch what happens to this winter coat retailer in January:
- Day 1: 42°F and clear—perfect weather for coat sales. But budget is the same as...
- Day 2: 68°F and sunny—coats don't sell. But they're spending the same amount.
- Day 3: Cold snap coming—demand spikes. But budget was already allocated yesterday.

The result? Wasted spend on low-demand days, under-investment on high-demand days. For weather-sensitive categories, this is a 20-40% efficiency loss."

## The Solution Part 1: Weather Intelligence (1:15-2:30)

**[VISUAL: Dashboard shifts to show "With Weather Intelligence" mode]**

"WeatherVane does three things:

**One: We quantify weather sensitivity.**

We analyze your historical sales data and weather. For this apparel brand, we found that temperature explains 22% of revenue variance. That's huge. It means weather is a primary demand driver.

**[VISUAL: Elasticity chart showing Temperature -108.9]**

Our math says: Each 1°C of temperature increase reduces demand by about 10.9%. For every 5-degree cold snap, demand jumps 54%. That's predictable.

**Two: We forecast 7-14 days ahead.**

We feed in the National Weather Service forecast. For this brand, we now know:
- Days 1-3: High-pressure system, temps dropping to 28°F. Strong coat demand coming.
- Days 4-7: Warm front moving in, temps 55-60°F. Coat demand collapsing.

**[VISUAL: Calendar view showing weather forecast overlay + demand forecast]**

**Three: We allocate dynamically.**

Instead of equal daily budgets, we allocate to high-demand windows.

Watch this: Same $100K budget, but distributed to weather windows:
- Spend $6K on warm days (low ROI, save the budget)
- Spend $8K on cold days (high ROI, capture the demand)

Our model predicts this will deliver 22% higher ROAS on allocated spend."

## The Solution Part 2: Real Results (2:30-3:45)

**[VISUAL: Plan page showing recommendations with confidence scores]**

"Let's see what the system recommends right now.

Texas, Gulf Region—tomorrow's forecast shows a heatwave. Temperature 98°F, humidity 72%. We know from your data that beverage demand spikes in heat.

**Recommendation**: Allocate $4,200 to Meta Advantage+ targeting beverage buyers in Texas.

**Expected outcome**:
- Revenue prediction: p10=$6.8K, p50=$11.2K, p90=$14.8K
- Projected ROAS: p50=2.67x
- Confidence: HIGH (based on 98% backtest coverage)

Why high confidence? Three things align:
1. Historical data: Beverage demand up 22% during heat anomalies
2. Forecast alignment: 3-day sustained heat predicted, high UV index
3. Inventory: You're at 96% of safety stock—ready to fulfill demand

Below that, Colorado Front Range—cold snap coming. Outerwear demand rising. Recommend Google Search spend there instead. Medium confidence because inventory is tighter."

**[VISUAL: Scroll through plan showing multiple recommendations across geos and channels]**

"Each recommendation includes:
- Weather driver (heatwave, cold snap, rain event, etc.)
- Historical lift evidence
- Inventory checks
- Confidence score (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Risk notes (if any)

Operators can approve one-click, or drill in to see the math."

## Real-World Impact (3:45-4:30)

**[VISUAL: Dashboard showing split test results: treated geos vs. control geos]**

"We validated this with a geo holdout experiment.

We took 4 test markets and allocated weather-optimized budgets. We held out 4 control markets with standard budgets.

**Results after 30 days**:

Treated markets (weather-optimized allocation):
- ROAS: 3.2x (vs. 2.8x baseline)
- Efficiency gain: +14%
- Spend per conversion: -$2.14

Why didn't control markets get the same uplift? Because they allocated budget on warm days when demand was low. Weather intelligence let us avoid that waste.

Extrapolate that across a $5M annual budget: That's $700K-$1M in incremental revenue with zero additional spend."

## Automation & Governance (4:30-4:50)

**[VISUAL: Automations tab showing approval workflow]**

"We know brands won't want manual approvals at scale.

WeatherVane offers three modes:

**Manual**: Review every recommendation. Guardrails enforce spending limits.

**Assist**: One-click approval batches. Recommendations queue for daily 7am sign-off. Guardrails re-check before any push.

**Automation**: Hands-off within pre-set limits. Daily spend caps, ROAS floors, CPA ceilings enforced. If anything breaches, automation pauses until an operator reviews.

It's not a black box. Every decision logs assumptions, weather driver, and confidence. Operators stay in control."

## Closing (4:50-5:00)

**[VISUAL: Dashboard returns to hero view, weather overlay animated]**

"That's WeatherVane in five minutes.

We integrate with Shopify, Meta, Google Ads, Klaviyo. We sit on top of your existing tools. No rip-and-replace.

For weather-sensitive brands, this is 15-30% ROAS improvement. Let's talk about what that means for your portfolio.

## On-Camera Talking Points (for Q&A)

**Q: How long before we see results?**
A: Geo holdout experiments show results in 2-4 weeks. Full incrementality measurement takes 6-8 weeks. But the model makes recommendations immediately.

**Q: What if our data is messy?**
A: We have a 98% backtest coverage requirement. If your data doesn't meet quality thresholds, we identify gaps and recommend what to track. Usually fixable in 1-2 months.

**Q: Does this work for non-weather-sensitive products?**
A: Weather-agnostic categories (office tech, software) show minimal lift. But there's zero downside—we just leave the spend constant for those. The real value comes from weather-sensitive SKUs, which represent 40-70% of most DTC portfolios.

**Q: What about competitive or promotional signals?**
A: Phase 2. Right now we optimize for weather + ad spend + inventory. We're building in competitor pricing and promo calendar for next quarter.
