In constrained sandboxes you can\\\\nalso install wheels into a per-repo directory and adjust `PYTHONPATH`, for example:\\\\n```bash\\\\npython -m pip install --target .deps polars numpy geohash2\\\\nPYTHONPATH=.deps:. python apps/worker/run.py demo-tenant --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-01-14\\\\n```\\\\nIf native wheels clash with the host BLAS/Accelerate libraries (manifesting as\\\\nsegmentation faults on import), rebuild the dependencies inside a dedicated virtualenv or\\\\nConda environment instead of the `.deps` shortcut. The allocator runs a pure-Python path by\\\\ndefault and only enables SciPy's differential-evolution solver when\\\\n`WEATHERVANE_ENABLE_SCIPY=1` is exported; this avoids linking crashes on constrained hosts.\\\\nThe time-series helpers expect `lightgbm` linked against `libomp`—ensure\\\\n`libomp.dylib` is present (Homebrew `libomp` or a source build with `USE_OPENMP=OFF`) when\\\\nrunning the worker end-to-end. If LightGBM is unavailable, the code falls back to\\\\n`HistGradientBoostingRegressor` so toy runs can still succeed, albeit with less accurate\\\\nelasticity modelling.\\\\n\\\\nRun a quick end-to-end smoke of the worker + data-context plumbing via:\\\\n```bash\\\\nmake smoke-context\\\\n```\\\\nThis exercises the synthetic tenant path, emits context tags, and is safe to wire into CI.\\\\n\\\\n## Project Layout\\\\n- `apps/api`: FastAPI app (routers, config, dependencies)\\\\n- `apps/web`: Next.js marketing + app shell\\\\n- `apps/worker`: Prefect flows and job runners\\\\n- `apps/model`: Model training entrypoints\\\\n- `apps/simulator`: Backtest/simulation utilities\\\\n- `shared/schemas`: Pydantic models shared across services\\\\n- `shared/libs`: Connector stubs, logging utilities, etc.\\\\n- `infra`: Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/Kubernetes placeholders)\\\\n- `docker`: Container images for API and web\\\\n\\\\n## Environment Variables\\\\nUpdate `.env` from the example with real credentials for Shopify, Meta Ads, Google Ads, and Klaviyo when wiring connectors. The API reads `CORS_ORIGINS`, `DATABASE_URL`, `LOG_LEVEL`, etc.\\\\n\\\\n### Context warning overrides\\\\nData-context warnings drive the guardrail messaging that appears in the API responses,\\\\nwebhooks, and UI context panels. By default the shared engine emits warnings for sparse\\\\nhistory, missing ads feeds, weather stubs, and high-null datasets. To customise or extend\\\\nthese rules, set `CONTEXT_WARNING_RULES` to a JSON array in `.env`:\\\\n\\\\n```env\\\\nCONTEXT_WARNING_RULES=[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\\\"match\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"history.short\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"severity\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"info\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Coverage is short but acceptable for assisted pushes\\\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\\\"match\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"catalog.missing\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"severity\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"critical\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"escalate_for_automation\\\\\\\": true,\\\\n    \\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Catalog data unavailable; pause automated pushes until restated\\\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nRules inherit missing fields (message/severity/escalation) from the default rule with the\\\\nsame `match`. New matches are appended to the rule set. `escalate_for_automation` raises\\\\nthe severity to `critical` whenever Autopilot or automated pushes are enabled.\\\\n\\\\n### Connector state\\\\nIncremental connectors (e.g., Shopify orders) persist their cursors in\\\\n`storage/metadata/state/<namespace>/<key>.json`. The helper `JsonStateStore` abstracts the\\\\nread/write cycle so ingestors can resume from the last `updated_at` without manual wiring.\\\\nFor local testing, the state directory lives under the repo root; in production point it at\\\\na durable volume.\\\\n\\\\n### Retention sweep automation\\\\nUse `python apps/worker/run.py --retention-only` to prune expired Parquet snapshots. Pass\\\\n`ALL` (or `--all-tenants`) to sweep every tenant discovered in the lake and set\\\\n`--retention-webhook-url` so ops dashboards receive a per-tenant `retention.sweep.completed`\\\\nevent plus a nightly `retention.sweep.summary` that captures tag coverage and warning counts.\\\\nProvide `--retention-summary-root` (for\\\\nexample `storage/metadata/state`) to persist the aggregate JSON locally for dashboards or\\\\naudit review, and `--context-root` when context snapshots live outside the default\\\\n`storage/metadata/data_context`. The Prefect deployment template at\\\\n`deployments/retention.yaml` defaults to automatic discovery; override the parameters or\\\\ninject the webhook URL, summary root, and context root at build time (e.g. with Prefect\\\\nblocks or CI secrets) before applying the schedule.\\\\n`python apps/worker/run.py --retention-report --retention-summary-root storage/metadata/state`\\\\nprints the latest summary on demand; append `--retention-report-day YYYY-MM-DD` to inspect\\\\na specific nightly record.\\\\n\\\\n### Geocoding coverage checks\\\\nThe PoC pipeline runs `evaluate_geocoding_coverage` after ingestion to ensure the latest\\\\norders snapshot carries geohashes. The helper stores a JSON report under\\\\n`storage/metadata/state/geocoding/<tenant>.json` with the sampled path, coverage ratio, and\\\\nstatus (`ok`, `warning`, `critical`, etc.). Context tags (`geo.partial`, `geo.missing`) and the\\\\npipeline response both surface the result so operators can intervene before weather joins\\\\ndegrade.\\\\n\\\\n### Smoke testing the pipeline\\\\nUse `python apps/worker/run.py <tenant> --smoke-test` to execute the PoC pipeline end-to-end. The\\\\ncommand prints a JSON summary containing plan status, ingestion sources, row counts, and geocoding\\\\ncoverage so you can diagnose missing connectors or degraded telemetry quickly. Without real API\\\\ncredentials the pipeline falls back to synthetic stubs, which is fine for local Apple Silicon runs.\\\\n\\\\nRun the same check via `make smoke-pipeline` if you prefer Make shortcuts. The command uses the\\\\n`.deps` virtual wheel directory so it behaves consistently with `make test` on Apple Silicon.\\\\nAdd `--log-file logs/smoke.ndjson` (or set `LOG_FILE` env) to capture NDJSON entries for observability\\\\npipelines.\\\\n\\\\n### Ingest→Feature→Plan harness\\\\n- Synthetic path: `PYTHONPATH=.deps:. pytest tests/worker/ingest_to_plan_live/test_live_connectors.py::test_ingest_to_plan_harness_synthetic`\\\\n  spins a tenant through ingest, feature, and plan stages using the stub connectors bundled with the repo.\\\\n- Live path: export Shopify/Meta/Google Ads credentials (`SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN`, `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`,\\\\n  `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_APP_ID`, `META_APP_SECRET`, `GOOGLEADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN`, `GOOGLEADS_CUSTOMER_ID`,\\\\n  `GOOGLEADS_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `GOOGLEADS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLEADS_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`) plus\\\\n  `HARNESS_LIVE_TENANT`, then run `PYTHONPATH=.deps:. pytest -m \\\\\\\"not slow\\\\\\\" tests/worker/ingest_to_plan_live -k live`.\\\\n  Tests skip automatically when credentials are absent.\\\\n- Metrics land under `tmp/metrics/<timestamp>/metrics.jsonl` by default; set `METRICS_OUTPUT_DIR` to override or\\\\n  inspect per-run directories emitted by `shared.observability.metrics`. Events:\\\\n  - `harness.summary` carries plan/geocoding status, connector sources, and dataset row counts.\\\\n  - `harness.guardrails` records allocation diagnostics (MAE/RMSE/quantile width).\\\\n  - `harness.window` logs the modeling lookback window.\\\\n  - `harness.retention` fires when the harness triggers a retention sweep.\\\\n- Tune lookback and retention knobs via env:\\\\n  - `HARNESS_SYNTHETIC_LOOKBACK_DAYS` / `HARNESS_LIVE_LOOKBACK_DAYS` (default 30)\\\\n  - `HARNESS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 365) and `HARNESS_LIVE_TENANT` / `HARNESS_SYNTHETIC_TENANT`.\\\\n- Harness helpers reuse the production `FeatureBuilder` to validate gradient-boosted defaults and weather joins.\\\\n  After a run, inspect feature projections with `python -q <<'PY' ...` or rehydrate via\\\\n  `FeatureBuilder().build(<tenant>, start, end)` to debug anomalies surfaced by the tests.\\\\n\\\\n### Dashboard exports\\\\nUse `make export-observability` (or invoke `python apps/worker/maintenance/export_observability.py`) to\\\\nwrite `retention.ndjson` and `geocoding.ndjson` under `observability/latest/`. These files are structured\\\\nfor direct ingestion into BigQuery or Loki; the roadmap calls for wiring this export into a scheduled job.\\\\n\\\\n### Secrets checklist\\\\nRun `python apps/worker/maintenance/secrets.py` (or `make check-secrets`) to verify required connector secrets are present in your\\\\nenvironment. The command highlights missing required values (Shopify tokens/domains) and optional but\\\\nrecommended credentials (Meta, Google Ads, Klaviyo). Use `--json` for CI-friendly output.\\\\n\\\\n## Next Steps Checklist\\\\n- Implement real connector clients under `shared/libs/connectors`.\\\\n- Add persistence layer (SQLAlchemy models, Alembic migrations).\\\\n- Flesh out worker flows for ingestion, modeling, and allocation.\\\\n- Connect frontend pages to live API endpoints.\\\\n- Expand end-to-end tests and CI pipeline.\\\\n\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}
