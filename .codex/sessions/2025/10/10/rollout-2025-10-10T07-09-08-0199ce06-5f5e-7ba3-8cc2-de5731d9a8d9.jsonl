This guide explains how the\\\\n`WeatherCache` blends Open-Meteo archive data with forecast responses, keeps timezones\\\\nhonest, and exposes the metadata modelling and UX layers rely on.\\\\n\\\\n## Key behaviours\\\\n\\\\n- **Dual-source fetches.** `WeatherCache.ensure_range` now orchestrates two upstream\\\\n  calls when the requested window spans today: the Open-Meteo archive API provides\\\\n  observed history up through \\\\\\\"yesterday\\\\\\\" while the forecast endpoint fills future\\\\ndays. Overlapping days prefer archive observations and drop forecast duplicates.\\\\n- **Timezone alignment.** All requests default to `timezone=auto`. Responses are\\\\n  normalised into four columns: `local_date`, `local_datetime`, `utc_datetime`, and\\\\n  `timezone`. We leverage `zoneinfo` so midnight boundaries always reflect the local\\\\n  clock for each geohash, but we also persist UTC strings for joins with Shopify and\\\\n  ads datasets.\\\\n- **Observation provenance.** Each row carries an `observation_type` flag\\\\n  (`observed`, `forecast`, or `stub` for synthetic fallbacks) plus an `as_of_utc`\\\\n  timestamp documenting when WeatherVane generated the record. Analytics can now\\\\n  separate realised weather from forward-looking signals, and front-end charts can\\\\n  label forecast horizons explicitly.\\\\n- **Contract update.** The daily weather schema (`shared/contracts/weather_daily.schema.json`)\\\\n  was expanded to cover the new timezone and provenance fields while keeping\\\\n  `additionalProperties=false`. Data quality checks (`validate_weather_daily`) enforce\\\\n  the contract before anything hits the lake.\\\\n\\\\n## Usage notes\\\\n\\\\n- The worker pipeline extends each tenant's weather request by\\\\n  `FORECAST_HORIZON_DAYS` (currently seven). Historical modelling still filters to the\\\\n  requested end date, while allocation and UX layers can read the forward span for\\\\n  opportunity cards.\\\\n- Cached payloads store the blended response (`generated_at`, units, timezone, and\\\\n  per-day observation types). Re-fetching a range pulls directly from disk with the\\\\n  same schema, so repeated runs are deterministic and fast.\\\\n- Synthetic fallbacks populate the extended schema, allowing local development without\\\\n  live API credentials.\\\\n\\\\nRefer to `apps/worker/flows/poc_pipeline.py::fetch_weather_data` for an example of the\\\\nblended output feeding downstream joins and telemetry.\\\\n\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}

Media Mix Modeling (MMM) Assessment\\\\n\\\\n**File:** `apps/model/mmm.py`\\\\n\\\\n### Current Implementation\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\n# Line 90-93: \\\\\\\"Elasticity\\\\\\\" is just correlation coefficient\\\\ncov = float(frame.select(pl.cov(pl.col(col), pl.col(revenue_col))).item())\\\\nelasticity_raw = cov / variance if variance else 0.0\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**This is NOT media mix modeling.** It's a simple covariance/variance calculation.\\\\n\\\\n### What's Missing\\\\n\\\\nReal MMM requires:\\\\n\\\\n#### 1.1 Adstock / Carryover Effects\\\\n**Problem:** Ads don't impact sales instantly. Someone sees an ad on Monday, buys on Thursday.\\\\n\\\\n**Solution:** Adstock transformation:\\\\n```python\\\\n# Geometric decay: today's effect = current spend + α × yesterday's effect\\\\nadstocked_spend[t] = spend[t] + alpha * adstocked_spend[t-1]\\\\n\\\\n# Or distributed lag:\\\\nadstocked_spend[t] = sum(theta[i] * spend[t-i] for i in range(lag_window))\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Impact:** Without adstock, you:\\\\n- Underestimate ad effectiveness (miss delayed conversions)\\\\n- Can't optimize pacing (front-load vs steady spend)\\\\n- Misattribute sales to organic when they're from earlier ads\\\\n\\\\n#### 1.2 Saturation Curves (Diminishing Returns)\\\\n**Problem:** First $1K of spend has higher ROAS than 10th $1K. Linear elasticity assumes constant marginal return.\\\\n\\\\n**Solution:** Hill/Michaelis-Menten saturation:\\\\n```python\\\\n# S-curve: response = K * spend^gamma / (half_sat^gamma + spend^gamma)\\\\nsaturated_response = K * (spend ** gamma) / (half_sat ** gamma + spend ** gamma)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Impact:** Without saturation:\\\\n- Recommend infinite spend (no diminishing returns modeled)\\\\n- Miss optimal spend point (where marginal ROAS = target)\\\\n- Can't identify wasted spend\\\\n\\\\n#### 1.3 Hierarchical Structure\\\\n**Problem:** Brand ads (awareness) and performance ads (conversion) work differently. Single-level model conflates them.\\\\n\\\\n**Solution:** Hierarchical Bayesian model:\\\\n```\\\\nRevenue ~ f(brand_spend, performance_spend, weather, seasonality)\\\\n  where brand_spend has long carryover (weeks)\\\\n        performance_spend has short carryover (days)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Impact:** Without hierarchy:\\\\n- Misattribute brand lift to performance\\\\n- Optimize for short-term conversions, harm long-term brand\\\\n- Can't separate \\\\\\\"new customers\\\\\\\" (brand-driven) from \\\\\\\"repeat buyers\\\\\\\" (performance)\\\\n\\\\n#### 1.4 Causal Identification\\\\n**Problem:** Correlation ≠ causation. Weather and revenue might both correlate with holidays/seasons.\\\\n\\\\n**Solution:** Instrumental variables or quasi-experimental design:\\\\n```\\\\n# Example: Use weather forecast errors as instrument\\\\n# (forecast error uncorrelated with actual demand drivers)\\\\nIV_estimate = Cov(revenue, weather_forecast_error) / Cov(actual_weather, weather_forecast_error)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Impact:** Without causal ID:\\\\n- Can't claim \\\\\\\"weather drove sales\\\\\\\"\\\\n- Recommendations might chase spurious correlations\\\\n- No defensibility in litigation/audits (\\\\\\\"you blamed weather for our losses\\\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n### Recommendation: Integrate Robyn or LightweightMMM\\\\n\\\\n**Option A: Meta's Robyn** (R package)\\\\n- Includes adstock, saturation, Bayesian priors\\\\n- Multi-objective optimization (sales + efficiency)\\\\n- Prophet for seasonality decomposition\\\\n- Industry-proven (Meta uses internally)\\\\n\\\\n**Option B: Google's LightweightMMM** (Python)\\\\n- Bayesian MMM with adstock + saturation via JAX\\\\n- Integrates with NumPyro for probabilistic programming\\\\n- Faster than Robyn, easier Python integration\\\\n\\\\n**Implementation path:**\\\\n```python\\\\n# apps/model/mmm_v2.py (new file)\\\\nfrom lightweight_mmm import LightweightMMM\\\\n\\\\ndef fit_mmm_v2(data, media_spend_cols, target_col):\\\\n    mmm = LightweightMMM()\\\\n    mmm.fit(\\\\n        media=data[media_spend_cols].to_numpy(),\\\\n        target=data[target_col].to_numpy(),\\\\n        media_prior=geometric_adstock_prior,  # Carryover\\\\n        extra_features=data[['temp_anomaly', 'precip_anomaly']].to_numpy()\\\\n    )\\\\n    return mmm\\\\n\\\\n# Get optimal allocation\\\\noptimal_budget = mmm.optimize_media(\\\\n    total_budget=100_000,\\\\n    target_roas=2.5\\\\n)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Effort:** 2-3 weeks for integration + validation\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## 2.

Causal Inference Assessment\\\\n\\\\n**Current Approach:** Correlation-based (LightGBM predicts revenue from weather + spend).\\\\n\\\\n**Problem:** Cannot distinguish:\\\\n- **Causal:** Weather → Demand → Revenue\\\\n- **Spurious:** Season → Weather + Demand → Revenue (both driven by holidays)\\\\n\\\\n### 3.1 Why Causality Matters\\\\n\\\\n**Scenario:** Model predicts \\\\\\\"Revenue increases when temp > 30°C\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**Possible explanations:**\\\\n1. ✅ Heat drives demand for cold drinks (CAUSAL - actionable)\\\\n2. ❌ Summer vacation → high temp AND high sales (SPURIOUS - not actionable)\\\\n3. ❌ July 4th → high temp AND promotions (CONFOUNDED - credit belongs to promo)\\\\n\\\\n**Without causal inference, you can't tell which is true.**\\\\n\\\\n### 3.2 Methods for Causal Identification\\\\n\\\\n#### Option A: Instrumental Variables (IV)\\\\n**Instrument:** Weather **forecast error** (predicted - actual)\\\\n\\\\n**Logic:** Forecast errors are random noise, uncorrelated with true demand drivers (holidays, promos), but correlated with actual weather.\\\\n\\\\n**Estimate:**\\\\n```python\\\\n# 2-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)\\\\n# Stage 1: Actual weather ~ Forecast error + controls\\\\n# Stage 2: Revenue ~ Predicted weather from stage 1\\\\n\\\\nfrom statsmodels.iv import IV2SLS\\\\n\\\\niv_model = IV2SLS(\\\\n    dependent=revenue,\\\\n    exog=[spend, seasonality, promos],  # Controls\\\\n    endog=[actual_weather],              # Endogenous (might be confounded)\\\\n    instruments=[forecast_error]         # Instrument (exogenous noise)\\\\n).fit()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Pro:** Identifies causal effect of weather on demand\\\\n**Con:** Requires historical forecast data (Open-Meteo doesn't provide forecast archives easily)\\\\n\\\\n#### Option B: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)\\\\n**Design:** Compare geos with weather shocks to geos without.\\\\n\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n- Texas has heatwave week 1 (treatment)\\\\n- California doesn't (control)\\\\n- Compare TX revenue change vs CA revenue change\\\\n\\\\n**Estimate:**\\\\n```python\\\\n# DiD regression\\\\nmodel = smf.ols(\\\\n    'revenue ~ treat * post + geo_fixed_effects + time_fixed_effects',\\\\n    data=panel_data\\\\n).fit()\\\\n\\\\n# treat = 1 if geo in treatment group\\\\n# post = 1 if time period after weather event\\\\n# Coefficient on treat*post = causal weather effect\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Pro:** Simple, intuitive, doesn't need instruments\\\\n**Con:** Requires parallel trends assumption (TX and CA would trend same without weather)\\\\n\\\\n#### Option C: Regression Discontinuity (RD)\\\\n**Design:** Compare outcomes just above vs just below weather threshold.\\\\n\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n- Days with temp = 31°C vs 29°C (around 30°C heatwave threshold)\\\\n- Assume demand is continuous across threshold\\\\n- Any jump = causal heatwave effect\\\\n\\\\n**Estimate:**\\\\n```python\\\\n# Local linear regression around threshold\\\\nfrom statsmodels.regression.quantile_regression import QuantReg\\\\n\\\\nrd_model = smf.ols(\\\\n    'revenue ~ above_threshold + temp_centered + above_threshold:temp_centered',\\\\n    data=data[abs(data.temp_c - 30) < 2]  # Narrow window\\\\n).fit()\\\\n\\\\n# Coefficient on above_threshold = causal jump at threshold\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Pro:** Very credible (clear counterfactual)\\\\n**Con:** Only identifies effect at threshold, not across full range\\\\n\\\\n#### Option D: DoWhy / EconML (Causal ML)\\\\n**Approach:** Use Microsoft's DoWhy + EconML libraries for heterogeneous treatment effects.\\\\n\\\\n**Workflow:**\\\\n```python\\\\nfrom dowhy import CausalModel\\\\nfrom econml.dml import CausalForestDML\\\\n\\\\n# 1.

Quantile Prediction & Calibration Assessment\\\\n\\\\n**File:** `apps/model/pipelines/poc_models.py` (Lines 65-73)\\\\n\\\\n### Current Approach: Residual Distribution\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\n# 1. Train point prediction model (LightGBM)\\\\nts_predictions = ts_result.model.predict(ts_features.to_numpy())\\\\n\\\\n# 2. Compute residuals (actual - predicted)\\\\nresiduals = actuals - ts_predictions\\\\n\\\\n# 3. Convert to relative errors\\\\nratio_residuals = residuals / prediction_safe\\\\ndistribution = np.clip(1.0 + ratio_residuals, 0.0, None)\\\\n\\\\n# 4. Take historical quantiles\\\\nq10 = float(np.quantile(distribution, 0.10))\\\\nq50 = float(np.quantile(distribution, 0.50))\\\\nq90 = float(np.quantile(distribution, 0.90))\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**This assumes residuals are stationary and i.i.d. (independent, identically distributed).**\\\\n\\\\n### Problems with This Approach\\\\n\\\\n#### 4.1 Non-Stationary Errors\\\\n**Assumption:** Error distribution is constant over time.\\\\n\\\\n**Reality:** Errors might be larger during:\\\\n- New product launches (more uncertainty)\\\\n- Volatile weather periods (forecast errors)\\\\n- Promotional weeks (behavioral shifts)\\\\n\\\\n**Result:** Quantiles computed on full history don't reflect current uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\n**Fix:** Use rolling window for quantile estimation:\\\\n```python\\\\n# Only use last 90 days of residuals\\\\nrecent_residuals = residuals[-90:]\\\\nq10, q50, q90 = np.quantile(recent_residuals, [0.1, 0.5, 0.9])\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### 4.2 Heteroskedasticity (Non-Constant Variance)\\\\n**Assumption:** Error size doesn't depend on predicted value.\\\\n\\\\n**Reality:** Larger predictions have larger errors (variance scales with level).\\\\n\\\\n**Result:** Wide confidence bands for high revenue, narrow for low revenue.\\\\n\\\\n**Fix:** Model variance as function of prediction:\\\\n```python\\\\n# Train separate model for error variance\\\\nvariance_model = LGBMRegressor()\\\\nvariance_model.fit(X, np.abs(residuals))\\\\n\\\\n# Generate prediction-specific quantiles\\\\npredicted_std = variance_model.predict(X_new)\\\\nq10 = prediction - 1.28 * predicted_std  # 1.28 = 10th percentile of normal\\\\nq90 = prediction + 1.28 * predicted_std\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### 4.3 No Calibration Validation\\\\n**Problem:** Never check if quantiles are accurate.\\\\n\\\\n**Test:** Do 80% of actual outcomes fall between p10 and p90?\\\\n\\\\n**Solution:** Calibration monitoring (already proposed in roadmap Phase 0.5):\\\\n```python\\\\n# apps/model/feedback/calibration.py\\\\ndef evaluate_calibration(predictions, actuals):\\\\n    in_range = (actuals >= predictions.p10) & (actuals <= predictions.p90)\\\\n    coverage = in_range.mean()\\\\n\\\\n    # Should be ~0.80; if <0.7 or >0.9, recalibrate\\\\n    return {\\\\n        'coverage_p10_p90': coverage,\\\\n        'sharpness': (predictions.p90 - predictions.p10).mean(),  # Prefer narrow + accurate\\\\n        'miscalibration': abs(coverage - 0.80)\\\\n    }\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Recommendation: Quantile Regression\\\\n\\\\nInstead of residual-based quantiles, **directly model quantiles**:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\n# Train 3 models: one for p10, p50, p90\\\\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMRegressor\\\\n\\\\nmodel_p10 = LGBMRegressor(objective='quantile', alpha=0.10)\\\\nmodel_p50 = LGBMRegressor(objective='quantile', alpha=0.50)\\\\nmodel_p90 = LGBMRegressor(objective='quantile', alpha=0.90)\\\\n\\\\nmodel_p10.fit(X_train, y_train)\\\\nmodel_p50.fit(X_train, y_train)\\\\nmodel_p90.fit(X_train, y_train)\\\\n\\\\n# Predictions are quantile-specific\\\\npred_p10 = model_p10.predict(X_new)\\\\npred_p50 = model_p50.predict(X_new)\\\\npred_p90 = model_p90.predict(X_new)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Advantages:**\\\\n- Quantiles adapt to heteroskedasticity automatically\\\\n- No stationarity assumption needed\\\\n- Guaranteed monotonicity (p10 ≤ p50 ≤ p90) with post-processing\\\\n\\\\n**Implementation:** 1-2 weeks (swap residual logic for quantile models)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Geographic Heterogeneity Assessment\\\\n\\\\n**Current Approach:** Single global model for all geographies.\\\\n\\\\n**Problem:** Weather effects vary by location:\\\\n- **Phoenix, AZ:** 40°C is normal summer → minimal demand impact\\\\n- **Seattle, WA:** 40°C is extreme heatwave → AC unit sales spike 500%\\\\n\\\\n### 5.1 Missing: Geographic Embeddings\\\\n\\\\n**Solution:** Learn location-specific parameters.\\\\n\\\\n#### Option A: Fixed Effects (Simple)\\\\n```python\\\\n# Add geo dummy variables\\\\nmodel = LGBMRegressor()\\\\nmodel.fit(\\\\n    X=pd.concat([\\\\n        X_features,\\\\n        pd.get_dummies(geo_column)  # One-hot encode geo\\\\n    ], axis=1),\\\\n    y=revenue\\\\n)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Pro:** Easy\\\\n**Con:** Doesn't share information across similar geos (Phoenix and Las Vegas should share \\\\\\\"desert\\\\\\\" characteristics)\\\\n\\\\n#### Option B: Hierarchical Model (Better)\\\\n```python\\\\n# Partial pooling: geo-specific effects regularized toward global mean\\\\nimport pymc as pm\\\\n\\\\nwith pm.Model() as hierarchical_model:\\\\n    # Global parameters\\\\n    beta_global = pm.Normal('beta_global', mu=0, sigma=1)\\\\n\\\\n    # Geo-specific deviations\\\\n    sigma_geo = pm.HalfNormal('sigma_geo', sigma=0.5)\\\\n    beta_geo = pm.Normal('beta_geo', mu=beta_global, sigma=sigma_geo, shape=n_geos)\\\\n\\\\n    # Likelihood\\\\n    mu = beta_geo[geo_idx] * weather + ...\\\\n    revenue = pm.Normal('revenue', mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Pro:** Shares information (small geos borrow strength from large geos)\\\\n**Con:** Slower training (MCMC sampling)\\\\n\\\\n#### Option C: Spatial Model (Best)\\\\n```python\\\\n# Model weather effect as smooth function of latitude/longitude\\\\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor\\\\n\\\\n# Feature: [lat, lon, temp_anomaly, precip_anomaly, ...]\\\\n# Target: revenue\\\\n\\\\ngp_model = GaussianProcessRegressor(\\\\n    kernel=RBF(length_scale=[1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5])  # Spatial smoothness\\\\n)\\\\ngp_model.fit(geo_features, revenue)\\\\n\\\\n# Predict for new geo (interpolates from nearby geos)\\\\npred = gp_model.predict([[lat_new, lon_new, temp, precip]])\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Pro:** Handles new geos gracefully (interpolates from neighbors)\\\\n**Con:** Computationally expensive for large datasets\\\\n\\\\n### 5.2 Recommendation: Geo-Stratified Models\\\\n\\\\n**Phase 1 (Quick win - 2 weeks):**\\\\n- Cluster geos by climate (K-means on historical weather stats)\\\\n- Train separate model per cluster (e.g., \\\\\\\"desert\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"coastal\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"continental\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"tropical\\\\\\\")\\\\n- Route predictions to appropriate cluster model\\\\n\\\\n**Phase 2 (Advanced - 4-6 weeks):**\\\\n- Hierarchical Bayesian model with partial pooling\\\\n- Estimate geo-specific weather elasticities\\\\n- Surface in UI: \\\\\\\"Heatwave impact in TX: +18% (Phoenix: +8%)\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## 6. Forecast Horizon & Uncertainty Assessment\\\\n\\\\n**Current Approach:** Generate 7-day plans using weather forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n**Problem:** Weather forecast accuracy degrades with horizon:\\\\n- **Day 1-2:** ~90% accurate (temperature within 2°C)\\\\n- **Day 3-5:** ~75% accurate (temperature within 4°C)\\\\n- **Day 6-7:** ~60% accurate (temperature within 6°C)\\\\n- **Day 8+:** Worse than climatology\\\\n\\\\n### 6.1 Missing: Forecast Uncertainty Propagation\\\\n\\\\n**Current:** Treat forecast as ground truth.\\\\n\\\\n**Reality:** Forecast has error distribution:\\\\n```\\\\nForecast: 35°C on Day 5\\\\nReality: Normal(35, σ=4°C) → could be 27°C (no heatwave) or 43°C (extreme)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Solution:** Monte Carlo sampling:\\\\n```python\\\\n# 1. Sample forecast errors from historical distribution\\\\nforecast_errors = np.random.normal(0, sigma_by_horizon[day], size=1000)\\\\n\\\\n# 2. Generate ensemble predictions\\\\nensemble_weather = forecast_temp + forecast_errors\\\\n\\\\n# 3. Predict revenue for each ensemble member\\\\nensemble_revenue = [model.predict(w) for w in ensemble_weather]\\\\n\\\\n# 4. Aggregate\\\\nrevenue_mean = np.mean(ensemble_revenue)\\\\nrevenue_p10 = np.quantile(ensemble_revenue, 0.10)\\\\nrevenue_p90 = np.quantile(ensemble_revenue, 0.90)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Impact:** Wider confidence bands for distant days (honest uncertainty)\\\\n\\\\n### 6.2 Missing: Adaptive Planning Horizon\\\\n\\\\n**Current:** Always 7 days.\\\\n\\\\n**Better:** Adjust by forecast quality:\\\\n- High confidence weather (Day 1-3): Tactical recommendations (spend adjustments)\\\\n- Low confidence weather (Day 4-7): Strategic hedges (prepare for scenarios)\\\\n\\\\n**UI:**\\\\n```\\\\nDay 1-3: \\\\\\\"Heatwave confirmed → Increase cold beverage ads 25%\\\\\\\"\\\\nDay 4-7: \\\\\\\"Possible heatwave (60% chance) → Prepare surge budget, monitor forecast\\\\\\\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 6.3 Recommendation: Forecast Quality Metadata\\\\n\\\\n**Implementation (1 week):**\\\\n```python\\\\n# shared/schemas/forecast.py\\\\n@dataclass\\\\nclass WeatherForecast:\\\\n    date: date\\\\n    temp_forecast: float\\\\n    precip_forecast: float\\\\n    temp_uncertainty: float      # NEW: Std dev of forecast error\\\\n    precip_uncertainty: float\\\\n    confidence_score: float      # NEW: 0-1 quality score by horizon\\\\n\\\\n# apps/model/ensemble.py\\\\ndef predict_with_forecast_uncertainty(model, forecast):\\\\n    if forecast.confidence_score > 0.8:\\\\n        # High confidence: use point forecast\\\\n        return model.predict(forecast.to_features())\\\\n    else:\\\\n        # Low confidence: ensemble sample\\\\n        samples = [\\\\n            model.predict(perturbed_forecast)\\\\n            for perturbed_forecast in forecast.sample_ensemble(n=100)\\\\n        ]\\\\n        return {\\\\n            'p10': np.quantile(samples, 0.10),\\\\n            'p50': np.median(samples),\\\\n            'p90': np.quantile(samples, 0.90)\\\\n        }\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## 7.
