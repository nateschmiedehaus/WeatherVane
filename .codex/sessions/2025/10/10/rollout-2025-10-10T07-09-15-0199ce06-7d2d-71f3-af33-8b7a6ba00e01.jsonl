Since the production code depends on NumPy, the module can't execute properly without it. I’m exploring whether the environment should use a vendored NumPy from `.deps` or a specialized Python executable (like from `.deps/bin`), maybe set up by scripts or altered `PYTHONPATH`. It looks like the pipeline might rely on Prefect and some custom environment zipped or named `=2.7`, so I’m planning to inspect that next to understand how this environment handles dependencies and execution."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABo6PmCX8TSF5ncjZFC8ReVGL2ILyeDiqo_jYXvl_RhW-SgJkn48w1UYLtsVvwr0cW1Jjuh2Rvgs19fQ_m6RizQBeerQ9s-pLeVHehv3ohf4BI-MAjwasPauF2VEnpBGh3p3JuoFJ0xcbzxgVzQ-ns0Vm6WohPqFQXGEnuxeNbfktFQi-xu_zzGzFlZyNktOGe2c3qilaRnQvwhuH-EUWQN6WiF_pLrByxRiX_q_UDYxb5UZkDBjMlz-_aL8tzWrTNHJzcZyaZfdO1Gnq58EFloAowgr30kYMWYmzWUrx7n8DwOZqbFo9zlUpqkaaCx_3kKuUXxANPoI-25FWXuZu0EJ4mHAPCrheGIt5tPWkIIkuEj5TvG_q1nTZ6vr6riLOZsVNBYhTbIavz-hI4gr9aBQLk_1sb4YCWE8CTlKVOkgCGnIkIbRlaENgbMWn7ekDytuNRPK7-j7W5E_LITKc5PTLQ50sCF60dHVYF4Ci8pLjdeWbyzlKZeg8WttvX9UG9SKpLYM_1i4lE0-9Bt-grxAZXckfOlr29Y7pVMgSghgA30Mpuu4tyM6_Z-wxQJ9_-c5SgNoaTu9mcXFp2nf10oIaUMl-QbbY2rUSrCv3PAJ-VmQMFlcmIdO0cMH7a-ZI1BZvEbGNBFpCdozF8MSeyfa7BkRGLXcv8oprduUYXHRumrsfDFr3QX5U39ElmVFcquYpN1ef1PARdVO45x-sd1jw1hvVEU_j2WcTSipuM70vt2okV-idLOIgf0NJxJHHdbmf-IOsBk1xKXEiR27en-CHFCn0YALNWw4Qd9SkoAAvdI38VZqD9VziPfZxikfd2nXIdodNtGUwFeTk1nSgHfUx9cxLjHuSxSyLFnNiaSTVNZ_wh1E4IjSZpQ6U6tVCe3QZ9xxQKHz2SSPxRnT7ce5FuNUsXgsBnpR1lPtiUZ_zIsQ8nRFmc-Uj3E0015kprsjCNPVNjq4tYUg_gF2Ha-T-UPMbfnNP2iFv2TMnQi6lnbnBVslPy_S4UWsxVe7xSlHsq3oUqJtxMhjYa8OUbzJ8pBmydU9L8Bfdo4opyA7aI9-ZuYUsAw4Zt9yNtT9oMw5PgCSmRijwCF9QNH_7tZr2e-2XEaNJdwUVehD_NUeRP4d9zY8UjRUBYeQHX01pKrXCAfPfi6znK1S1bGhtN3dtb2JpFQzuMHYw76byz9V7XwJkjFkzrvjOPiDndx4El3BglOJc69lkVqcQow6D_IUyubOyQa0-Vbd_PV4kqpfWfcxsukwn_LehyrL4PfsA1URGMWTQEvqQjzRfDtEvVCvG8-e-ZvD9AhnF-CJZaAxnArOdbNBad0xHEGp0XSJv6Mi96TIXMrqK9nleawI1ylbIYgxHr_Pbc3q5J-LCUSIfnFNaMGm5kV6IDaHR_GO1DUG6lvoSWABkKuevEpFjX7Vb1IYUe-Z7-RaMBYM5Q7qRpEcO-AbMD5acliemFMiaKJ543RXwvN-VrjJgxwLpxqDtLVO6i197J0ugNdAkkBFTTbDf2Uj6NInu65ws8ZZdr04Z5GIumZ7EkGso6C-LKklEOJJgp-vjqemB5DBNHzK313hRIQLDVL8WW6JQJvk0LmgGIh66l9W_ElDhUQKaWJRfZJ4or-EcyJ_y7_BXkjaQyUTzQUNhAbzvZtwfL2oncpGoOiRYBoR0UkDYnmXRAdOMmiO3xC5MG_WBeubUKc9ZvOWkg0HZLXGnHRNt9AtfWRk_1n0li12wT_YNX2HG_PtWj-xbZzUSYrGhsheMXarHn-wK53yZoVr0NxGgTJDtUcWEUUYvbtza4GwzE54EMn1hi2HxxNpPfZLuqjAKEl9ThvMWaYfzNtXvhzsUAU9sYtjLWzofW6dIRkZTlRI1AcNn0qXLGpdnpI2tomr6D-15zIj_3s9vWj-JNO2FtNzok9-__CI924vZnH6eEx6QxJ8d3ZSdCEFPjMEA7Jf7iTyi-USaxr2RVrg_4Hvouq45wF-XLr6qksFSJ2PWdyaEAyqI_e9LCCfLxEjTxtdext-Ee3oEt-E-cwcqB3JX514jx-KptVwGSwmgiK4gvbyCcMngN4pT6fF62tdEbWLYFnQI8JVdy1z2CiyslcAWrcr_wrCYoaecU-gn-xzQe3VWW31O-XXkQHNMUgQyw5bV2NDEcFfmSM2ov-fbWYBmDxqewgvYD_x5GcfFF-ierVNjpW1oumHffXf8184cq2_XWEvUsEXX4affwByzfIvAJgqRoaWLpKLXGBuD7AUAa2N27D8u68ppiJCRa_C-W6GpOQCKAHRLn--2Q24Ra8QtL-DC1xUMllLxs2XYz6cGdK9qFbuUYrVrBEsaamI24LK2crf6bnqLtsAmPIBr_KEhMDhxoMiTG1TGssr6qKrCJuiIsRKlS4pa7MTQx2neOevpy_cwK76mcfM_eInfZmpEc8fzoRgbPFRgMSqqa3Ej8DwCBrDRKghPGZo-uFBGyJisqr3CSFKs4e2ZJQCq05ovOItS7VmQwllnakUf57ubAbbltQpjVqg6ICcrykgUj0yOI8WBBkIxss0f4WkQIo5lk2c9j_0tsP7IhwQlXQ69TvKsuiHQ8JyclC2N184z_htrNYGbiL2NwNV2jiyxmjKvUTrMXgmqesBkrkdnM4k1j4X34UMxOhhhcMedLROC-3bc113yDwkCx81qlHFZHtkz72dS1hi__6q-rMv08-7HgEaVSvPVilNErqDH4AYKvGYzJ-Dn-XkfafU8OAC7qU8NWG0VHOJtjO4f_RkB5YgIgPYdr_hSOAIB9Bfnv_zIIXXNbos47JTteBT8_MDPUuVxunGiKSe3CIvMKN0kOaSAurxGDyySKjQbU9vhLjxajXyrBx_H1KEKn0Y7qgyNET9HtVW2TgzMBtNo1lK-OMlzsfnk8axnp-xtKx6cqRkBzyGyUcG6_hwXAphFV8fhTPq2SlSm-X5pIbTTbLGXEg6E_tjRZxu2bUDMYQcAcc-f1dH_6RRopUbtJ0PVCpeL68WpYtXWO9z9t3yB4msYTP4AuDQNrQC4Fv45pr8E0JDYZdHUCHiBQUW26sq5HaUa9IuLtpudEVWrRy_Nkx7khKJSHbY_0z8OzeYjhe0zlJS8eh2N9C78rZSYa3PwPltirlEWGmzhUje0ZvsaGWT0Z1ktjDjVLZYwygGf5d_bQVKpX-Xw_Lfm4SQVqn21CHjjt6UY7pEbGs74F7tz6HVzLjYwKseTxNmeV3vlyV7CyQBF8sjOZr8iWDosZNetZ-imKdl65TgtbH00V8qfeevPvHNenMoN25Sp4_aN76IEYCJ7cdQ6yOsNfWYXI="}}

To fix this, I plan to build the future DataFrame explicitly with the original DataFrame’s schema using `pl.DataFrame(future_rows, schema=full_frame.schema)` which should align all column types correctly and avoid casting issues. Removing redundant casts and relying on Polars to handle conversions seems like the right approach."}}
