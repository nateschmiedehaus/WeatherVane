I’m also thinking through updates to enrich orders with geo info, handling cache keys, and sketching tests to verify fallback behavior and caching persistence. This involves defining helper functions for postal and city lookups to ease testing and implementing various normalization, caching, and fallback strategies while accounting for the environment’s package limitations and data handling nuances."}}

I’m also thinking through updates to enrich orders with geo info, handling cache keys, and sketching tests to verify fallback behavior and caching persistence. This involves defining helper functions for postal and city lookups to ease testing and implementing various normalization, caching, and fallback strategies while accounting for the environment’s package limitations and data handling nuances."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Implementing caching and test preparations**\n\nI'm focusing on implementing caching for city lookups similarly to postal lookups, ensuring consistent cache keys and normalization.
