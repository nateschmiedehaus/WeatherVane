Source code is mounted for hot reloads.\\\\n\\\\n## Testing & Linting\\\\n```bash\\\\nmake lint\\\\nmake test\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThese run Ruff/ESLint and Pytest/Next.js tests respectively. Formatting helper:\\\\n```bash\\\\nmake format\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Worker / PoC Pipeline Dependencies\\\\nThe worker CLI and PoC pipeline rely on scientific Python packages such as `polars`,\\\\n`numpy`, and `scikit-learn`. Install the editable project dependency set before running\\\\n`python apps/worker/run.py`:\\\\n```bash\\\\npip install -e .[dev]\\\\n```\\\\nIf the real Prefect package cannot be installed, the repository includes a lightweight\\\\nshim under `prefect/` so flows can still execute locally. In constrained sandboxes you can\\\\nalso install wheels into a per-repo directory and adjust `PYTHONPATH`, for example:\\\\n```bash\\\\npython -m pip install --target .deps polars numpy geohash2\\\\nPYTHONPATH=.deps:. python apps/worker/run.py demo-tenant --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-01-14\\\\n```\\\\nIf native wheels clash with the host BLAS/Accelerate libraries (manifesting as\\\\nsegmentation faults on import), rebuild the dependencies inside a dedicated virtualenv or\\\\nConda environment instead of the `.deps` shortcut. The allocator runs a pure-Python path by\\\\ndefault and only enables SciPy's differential-evolution solver when\\\\n`WEATHERVANE_ENABLE_SCIPY=1` is exported; this avoids linking crashes on constrained hosts.\\\\nThe time-series helpers expect `lightgbm` linked against `libomp`—ensure\\\\n`libomp.dylib` is present (Homebrew `libomp` or a source build with `USE_OPENMP=OFF`) when\\\\nrunning the worker end-to-end. If LightGBM is unavailable, the code falls back to\\\\n`HistGradientBoostingRegressor` so toy runs can still succeed, albeit with less accurate\\\\nelasticity modelling.\\\\n\\\\nRun a quick end-to-end smoke of the worker + data-context plumbing via:\\\\n```bash\\\\nmake smoke-context\\\\n```\\\\nThis exercises the synthetic tenant path, emits context tags, and is safe to wire into CI.\\\\n\\\\n## Project Layout\\\\n- `apps/api`: FastAPI app (routers, config, dependencies)\\\\n- `apps/web`: Next.js marketing + app shell\\\\n- `apps/worker`: Prefect flows and job runners\\\\n- `apps/model`: Model training entrypoints\\\\n- `apps/simulator`: Backtest/simulation utilities\\\\n- `shared/schemas`: Pydantic models shared across services\\\\n- `shared/libs`: Connector stubs, logging utilities, etc.\\\\n- `infra`: Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/Kubernetes placeholders)\\\\n- `docker`: Container images for API and web\\\\n\\\\n## Environment Variables\\\\nUpdate `.env` from the example with real credentials for Shopify, Meta Ads, Google Ads, and Klaviyo when wiring connectors. The API reads `CORS_ORIGINS`, `DATABASE_URL`, `LOG_LEVEL`, etc.\\\\n\\\\n### Context warning overrides\\\\nData-context warnings drive the guardrail messaging that appears in the API responses,\\\\nwebhooks, and UI context panels. By default the shared engine emits warnings for sparse\\\\nhistory, missing ads feeds, weather stubs, and high-null datasets. To customise or extend\\\\nthese rules, set `CONTEXT_WARNING_RULES` to a JSON array in `.env`:\\\\n\\\\n```env\\\\nCONTEXT_WARNING_RULES=[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\\\"match\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"history.short\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"severity\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"info\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Coverage is short but acceptable for assisted pushes\\\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\\\"match\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"catalog.missing\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"severity\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"critical\\\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\\\"escalate_for_automation\\\\\\\": true,\\\\n    \\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Catalog data unavailable; pause automated pushes until restated\\\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nRules inherit missing fields (message/severity/escalation) from the default rule with the\\\\nsame `match`. New matches are appended to the rule set. `escalate_for_automation` raises\\\\nthe severity to `critical` whenever Autopilot or automated pushes are enabled.\\\\n\\\\n### Connector state\\\\nIncremental connectors (e.g., Shopify orders) persist their cursors in\\\\n`storage/metadata/state/<namespace>/<key>.json`. The helper `JsonStateStore` abstracts the\\\\nread/write cycle so ingestors can resume from the last `updated_at` without manual wiring.\\\\nFor local testing, the state directory lives under the repo root; in production point it at\\\\na durable volume.\\\\n\\\\n### Retention sweep automation\\\\nUse `python apps/worker/run.py --retention-only` to prune expired Parquet snapshots. Pass\\\\n`ALL` (or `--all-tenants`) to sweep every tenant discovered in the lake and set\\\\n`--retention-webhook-url` so ops dashboards receive a per-tenant `retention.sweep.completed`\\\\nevent plus a nightly `retention.sweep.summary` that captures tag coverage and warning counts.\\\\nProvide `--retention-summary-root` (for\\\\nexample `storage/metadata/state`) to persist the aggregate JSON locally for dashboards or\\\\naudit review, and `--context-root` when context snapshots live outside the default\\\\n`storage/metadata/data_context`. The Prefect deployment template at\\\\n`deployments/retention.yaml` defaults to automatic discovery; override the parameters or\\\\ninject the webhook URL, summary root, and context root at build time (e.g. with Prefect\\\\nblocks or CI secrets) before applying the schedule.\\\\n`python apps/worker/run.py --retention-report --retention-summary-root storage/metadata/state`\\\\nprints the latest summary on demand; append `--retention-report-day YYYY-MM-DD` to inspect\\\\na specific nightly record.\\\\n\\\\n### Geocoding coverage checks\\\\nThe PoC pipeline runs `evaluate_geocoding_coverage` after ingestion to ensure the latest\\\\norders snapshot carries geohashes. The helper stores a JSON report under\\\\n`storage/metadata/state/geocoding/<tenant>.json` with the sampled path, coverage ratio, and\\\\nstatus (`ok`, `warning`, `critical`, etc.). Context tags (`geo.partial`, `geo.missing`) and the\\\\npipeline response both surface the result so operators can intervene before weather joins\\\\ndegrade.\\\\n\\\\n### Smoke testing the pipeline\\\\nUse `python apps/worker/run.py <tenant> --smoke-test` to execute the PoC pipeline end-to-end. The\\\\ncommand prints a JSON summary containing plan status, ingestion sources, row counts, and geocoding\\\\ncoverage so you can diagnose missing connectors or degraded telemetry quickly. Without real API\\\\ncredentials the pipeline falls back to synthetic stubs, which is fine for local Apple Silicon runs.\\\\n\\\\nRun the same check via `make smoke-pipeline` if you prefer Make shortcuts. The command uses the\\\\n`.deps` virtual wheel directory so it behaves consistently with `make test` on Apple Silicon.\\\\nAdd `--log-file logs/smoke.ndjson` (or set `LOG_FILE` env) to capture NDJSON entries for observability\\\\npipelines.\\\\n\\\\n### Ingest→Feature→Plan harness\\\\n- Synthetic path: `PYTHONPATH=.deps:. pytest tests/worker/ingest_to_plan_live/test_live_connectors.py::test_ingest_to_plan_harness_synthetic`\\\\n  spins a tenant through ingest, feature, and plan stages using the stub connectors bundled with the repo.\\\\n- Live path: export Shopify/Meta/Google Ads credentials (`SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN`, `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`,\\\\n  `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_APP_ID`, `META_APP_SECRET`, `GOOGLEADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN`, `GOOGLEADS_CUSTOMER_ID`,\\\\n  `GOOGLEADS_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `GOOGLEADS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLEADS_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`) plus\\\\n  `HARNESS_LIVE_TENANT`, then run `PYTHONPATH=.deps:. pytest -m \\\\\\\"not slow\\\\\\\" tests/worker/ingest_to_plan_live -k live`.\\\\n  Tests skip automatically when credentials are absent.\\\\n- Metrics land under `tmp/metrics/<timestamp>/metrics.jsonl` by default; set `METRICS_OUTPUT_DIR` to override or\\\\n  inspect per-run directories emitted by `shared.observability.metrics`. Events:\\\\n  - `harness.summary` carries plan/geocoding status, connector sources, and dataset row counts.\\\\n  - `harness.guardrails` records allocation diagnostics (MAE/RMSE/quantile width).\\\\n  - `harness.window` logs the modeling lookback window.\\\\n  - `harness.retention` fires when the harness triggers a retention sweep.\\\\n- Tune lookback and retention knobs via env:\\\\n  - `HARNESS_SYNTHETIC_LOOKBACK_DAYS` / `HARNESS_LIVE_LOOKBACK_DAYS` (default 30)\\\\n  - `HARNESS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 365) and `HARNESS_LIVE_TENANT` / `HARNESS_SYNTHETIC_TENANT`.\\\\n- Harness helpers reuse the production `FeatureBuilder` to validate gradient-boosted defaults and weather joins.\\\\n  After a run, inspect feature projections with `python -q <<'PY' ...` or rehydrate via\\\\n  `FeatureBuilder().build(<tenant>, start, end)` to debug anomalies surfaced by the tests.\\\\n\\\\n### Dashboard exports\\\\nUse `make export-observability` (or invoke `python apps/worker/maintenance/export_observability.py`) to\\\\nwrite `retention.ndjson` and `geocoding.ndjson` under `observability/latest/`. These files are structured\\\\nfor direct ingestion into BigQuery or Loki; the roadmap calls for wiring this export into a scheduled job.\\\\n\\\\n### Secrets checklist\\\\nRun `python apps/worker/maintenance/secrets.py` (or `make check-secrets`) to verify required connector secrets are present in your\\\\nenvironment.

The branch is ahead of `origin/main` by one commit.\\n- Shell startup emits `brew` and `pyenv` errors, indicating brittle local tooling (`.bash_profile` assumes Homebrew at `/usr/local/bin` and writable pyenv shims).\\n- `docs/STATUS.md` and `state/context.md` still reference task T2.2.1 as in-progress, diverging from the roadmap where it is marked `done`.\\n- Prior blockers recorded: local numpy import crashes preventing `make test` / critics runs.\\n\\n## Bottlenecks Impacting Velocity\\n1. **Dirty workspace & artifact sprawl** – dozens of tracked edits plus large metric dumps slow down reviews and staging; lack of `tmp/` ignore rules caused repeated churn.\\n2. **Environment fragility** – shell startup errors and numpy crashes erode confidence in local verification, delaying release-readiness checks.\\n3. **Stale operational status** – conflicting status docs make it harder to communicate readiness and hand off reviews quickly.\\n4. **Sparse cadence data** – only five commits in 30 days suggests low iteration throughput or unmerged local work, risking large, hard-to-review changesets.\\n\\n## Recommended Actions\\n1. **Stabilise local tooling**\\n   - Prune `.bash_profile` of hard-coded Homebrew paths; gate brew sourcing on existence to avoid CI noise.\\n   - Regenerate pyenv shims with a writable prefix (e.g., repo-local `.venv`) to unblock Python tooling.\\n   - Pin numpy/scientific stack via `make bootstrap` + `.deps` wheels and document working Apple Silicon flow (see docs/DEVELOPMENT.md updates).\\n2. **Enforce clean working tree policies**\\n   - Keep `tmp/` artifacts gitignored (landed in `.gitignore` via this task).\\n   - Add `tmp/metrics/` to CI purge list or emit to `storage/metrics/` which is already ignored.\\n   - Introduce a `make preflight` (lint + tests + git diff guard) to fail early when dirty.\\n3. **Refresh operational dashboards**\\n   - Update `docs/STATUS.md` & `state/context.md` post-task completion (performed alongside this review).\\n   - Automate status digest generation off roadmap to avoid drift.\\n4. **Track and raise cadence**\\n   - Set a daily (or per-PR) deploy log capturing `commit -> deployment` timestamps.\\n   - Schedule bi-weekly shipping reviews checking critics history, outstanding blockers, and PR queue length.\\n   - Encourage slicing: merge smaller vertical increments to keep `git log --since 7 days` ≥10 commits.\\n\\n## Immediate Next Steps\\n- ✅ Add `tmp/` to `.gitignore` (done in this review).\\n- ☐ Create automation to clean `tmp/metrics/` directories after tests.\\n- ☐ Land `.bash_profile` guard rails in developer environment template.\\n- ☐ Stand up a simple `scripts/velocity_report.py` (cron-able) that surfaces commits per week and open PRs.\\n- ☐ Ensure numpy/pyenv crash is tracked as a P0 infra ticket; unblock `make test` locally.\\n\\n## Owner\\nTask `T_AUTO_1760092275 – Shipping velocity check`\\n\"}","call_id":"call_Fa0WPk1yOiykQmZhAzUFGDpS"}}

synthetic fixtures fall back to linear, so confirm GAM execution on a fuller tenant before allocator assumptions rely on splines.\n-- Polars warns about `NUMERIC_DTYPES` deprecation; track a migration to `polars.selectors` to avoid future breaks.\n-\n-## Next actions\n-- Run critics: build, tests, manager_self_check, data_quality, design_system, org_pm, exec_review, health_check, human_sync, plus causal and academic_rigor for T2.2.1.\n-- Plumb the trainer into worker orchestration/Make targets for repeatable CI retraining.\n-- Capture marginal effect exports in a follow-up to unlock allocator visualisations.\n-\n-## Current Focus\n-T2.2.1 – hardening the weather-aware GAM baseline so pyGAM fits succeed in CI, updating docs, and staging roadmap closure once validation is unblocked.\n-\n-## Decisions\n-- Added multi-strategy GAM fitter (grid search → direct fit → vanilla LinearGAM) to recover from collinearity/solver hiccups before falling back to linear regression.\n-\n-## Risks\n-- Local Python runtime still crashes on `numpy` import, blocking pytest/critics execution; need confirmation on a sane CI node before shipping.\n-\n-## Next Actions\n-- Attempt critics/tests again once numpy wheel issue is resolved or alternative environment is available.\n-- If critics pass upstream, mark T2.2.1 done and proceed to allocator follow-up tasks.\n-\n-## Roadmap Snapshot (truncated)\n-```yaml\n-epics:\n-  - id: E1\n-    title: Epic 1 — Ingest & Weather Foundations\n-    description: Stand up weather + marketing ingestion, harmonise geo/time, and\n-      validate data quality.\n-    milestones:\n-      - id: M1.1\n-        title: Connector scaffolding\n-        tasks:\n-          - id: T1.1.1\n-            title: Design Open-Meteo + Shopify connectors and data contracts\n-            owner: WVO\n-            estimate_hours: 6\n-            status: done\n-            exit_criteria:\n-              - critic: build\n-              - critic: tests\n-              - doc: docs/INGESTION.md\n-          - id: T1.1.2\n-            title: Implement ingestion Prefect flow with checkpointing\n-            owner: WVO\n-            estimate_hours: 8\n-            status: done\n-            dependencies:\n-              - T1.1.1\n-            exit_criteria:\n-              - critic: data_quality\n-              - critic: org_pm\n-              - artifact: experiments/ingest/dq_report.json\n-      - id: M1.2\n-        title: Weather harmonisation\n-        tasks:\n-          - id: T1.2.1\n-            title: Blend historical + forecast weather, enforce timezone alignment\n-            owner: WVO\n-            estimate_hours: 6\n-            status: done\n-            exit_criteria:\n-              - critic: forecast_stitch\n-              - doc: docs/weather/blending.md\n-          - id: T1.2.2\n-            title: Add leakage guardrails to feature builder\n-            owner: WVO\n-            estimate_hours: 4\n-            status: done\n-            dependencies:\n-              - T1.2.1\n-            exit_criteria:\n-              - critic: leakage\n-              - critic: tests\n-  - id: E2\n-    title: Epic 2 — Features & Modeling Baseline\n-    description: Ship lagged features, baseline models, and evaluation harness.\n-    milestones:\n-      - id: M2.1\n-        title: Feature pipeline\n-        tasks:\n-          - id: T2.1.1\n-            title: Build lag/rolling feature generators with deterministic seeds\n-            owner: WVO\n-            estimate_hours: 6\n-            status: done\n-            exit_criteria:\n-              - critic: build\n-              - critic: tests\n-              - critic: data_quality\n-      - id: M2.2\n-        title: Baseline modeling\n-        tasks:\n-          - id: T2.2.1\n-            title: Train weather-aware GAM baseline and document methodology\n-            owner: WVO\n-            estimate_hours: 8\n-            status: pending\n-            exit_criteria:\n-              - critic: causal\n-              - critic: academic_rigor\n-              - doc: docs/models/baseline.md\n-  - id: E3\n-    title: Epic 3 — Allocation & UX\n-    description: Allocator robustness checks, dashboards, and UI polish.\n-    milestones:\n-      - id: M3.1\n-        title: Allocator guardrails\n-        tasks:\n-          - id: T3.1.1\n-            title: Implement budget allocator stress tests and regret bounds\n-            owner: WVO\n-            estimate_hours: 7\n-            status: done\n-            exit_criteria:\n-              - critic: allocator\n-              - critic: cost_perf\n-              - artifact: experiments/policy/regret.json\n-      - id: M3.2\n-        title: Dashboard + UX review\n-        tasks:\n-          - id: T3.2.1\n-            title: Run design system critic and ensure accessibility coverage\n-            owner: WVO\n-            estimate_hours: 5\n-            status: done\n-            exit_criteria:\n-              - critic: design_system\n-              - critic: exec_review\n-\n-```\n+# WeatherVane Status Digest\n+_Updated: 2025-10-10T12:05:00Z (profile: medium)_\n+\n+## Current Focus\n+Epic 4 – Operational Excellence: driving shipping velocity checks, performance sweeps, and critical tech-debt cleanup.\n+\n+## Recent Decisions\n+- Added `tmp/` to `.gitignore` to keep working trees clean for rapid shipping.\n+- Logged shipping velocity findings in `docs/SHIPPING_VELOCITY.md`, capturing cadence metrics and prioritized remediations.\n+- Reset status/context documents to reflect completed modeling baseline (T2.2.1) and the new optimization phase.\n+\n+## Risks\n+- Local Python runtime continues to crash on `numpy` import for some environments;
