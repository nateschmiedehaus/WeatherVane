Since lazy attribute access via `__getattr__` may fail due to import crashes or missing attributes, I'm considering changing the module to eagerly import needed submodules and set attributes at import time to avoid import errors, even if it means loading heavy dependencies upfront. This should clarify if the fault stems from lazy imports or environment constraints."}}
