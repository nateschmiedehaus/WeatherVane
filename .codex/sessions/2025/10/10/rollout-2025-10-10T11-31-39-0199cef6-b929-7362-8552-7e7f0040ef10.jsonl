The goals:\\\\n- Every source looks the same (easy to read, easy to debug)\\\\n- Junior engineers can copy/paste an existing pattern\\\\n- The Prefect flow remains clean and declarative\\\\n\\\\n## Core Concepts\\\\n\\\\n| Component | Location | Responsibility |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `BaseIngestor`, `IngestionSummary` | `apps/worker/ingestion/base.py` | Shared helpers and return type (path + row count + source + metadata) |\\\\n| Connector wrappers | `shared/libs/connectors` | Handle raw HTTP/gRPC calls (pagination, retries, OAuth refresh) |\\\\n| Ingester modules | `apps/worker/ingestion/<source>.py` | Normalise records and store Parquet snapshots |\\\\n| Storage utilities | `shared/libs/storage/lake.py` | Write/read Parquet via Polars (single entry point) |\\\\n| Prefect flows | `apps/worker/flows/*.py` | Call ingestors, log summaries, feed modelling tasks |\\\\n\\\\n## Adding a New Ingester\\\\n\\\\n1. Create `apps/worker/ingestion/<source>.py`.\\\\n   - Import `BaseIngestor`, `IngestionSummary`, and the relevant connector/config.\\\\n   - Normalise API responses into flat dictionaries (no nested JSON in Parquet).\\\\n   - Call `self._write_records(dataset, rows, source=...)` to persist results.\\\\n   - Return `IngestionSummary`.\\\\n2. Write tests under `tests/test_<source>_ingestion.py` using stub connectors.\\\\n   - Verify the ingestor writes Parquet and returns the correct row count.\\\\n3. Update Prefect flow (`poc_pipeline.py`) to call the new ingestor.\\\\n   - Keep the task wrapper small; it should focus on logging and returning summaries.\\\\n4. Document any required environment variables in this file and `docs/STACK.md` if needed.\\\\n5. Persist incremental state using `JsonStateStore` when the source supports cursors (for example `updated_at_min`).\\\\n\\\\n## Environment Variables (Shopify example)\\\\n```\\\\nSHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN=<my-shop.myshopify.com>\\\\nSHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=<admin api token>\\\\nSHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-04  # optional\\\\n# Optional, used for OAuth token refresh\\\\nSHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID=<oauth client id>\\\\nSHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<oauth client secret>\\\\nSHOPIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=<oauth refresh token>\\\\n```\\\\nIf an environment variable is missing, the task deliberately falls back to stub data for local\\\\nprototyping. This behaviour is visible in the logs and the returned `source` field.\\\\n\\\\n## Pagination & Rate Limits\\\\n- `DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT` keeps requests small; adjust if Shopify introduces new limits.\\\\n- For other connectors, implement exponential backoff or rate limiting if required.\\\\n- Store the raw `next_page_info` (or equivalent token) in your loop to avoid infinite paging.\\\\n\\\\n## Meta Ads\\\\n- Graph API base URL is `https://graph.facebook.com/<graph_version>`.\\\\n- The connector follows `paging.cursors.after` (or parses `paging.next`) until exhausted.\\\\n- Automatic retries/backoff leverage the shared HTTP connector; plug in `AsyncRateLimiter` to stay under burst limits.\\\\n- On HTTP 401 the connector exchanges the short-lived token using `app_id`/`app_secret` and updates headers transparently.\\\\n\\\\nEnvironment variables:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nMETA_ACCESS_TOKEN=<short-lived or long-lived token>\\\\nMETA_APP_ID=<facebook app id>\\\\nMETA_APP_SECRET=<facebook app secret>\\\\nMETA_GRAPH_VERSION=v19.0\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPersist the refreshed token to your secrets store if you want subsequent runs to reuse it; otherwise\\\\nthe connector refreshes in-memory whenever Meta invalidates the token.\\\\n\\\\n## Google Ads\\\\n- REST endpoint base: `https://googleads.googleapis.com/<version>/customers/{cid}/googleAds:search`.\\\\n- Requests are POST with GAQL queries; the connector handles `nextPageToken` pagination and yields rows via `search_iter`.\\\\n- Retries/backoff use the shared HTTP connector; add an async rate limiter to respect QPS caps.\\\\n- On HTTP 401 the connector exchanges the refresh token for a new access token (`oauth2.googleapis.com/token`) and updates headers.\\\\n\\\\nEnvironment variables / secrets:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nGOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=<developer token>\\\\nGOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID=<oauth client id>\\\\nGOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET=<oauth client secret>\\\\nGOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN=<oauth refresh token>\\\\nGOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID=<manager customer id, optional>\\\\nGOOGLE_ADS_ACCESS_TOKEN=<optional bootstrap access token>\\\\nGOOGLE_ADS_API_VERSION=v14\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFor local smoke tests you can omit `GOOGLE_ADS_ACCESS_TOKEN`; the connector will immediately refresh using the\\\\nrefresh token. Persist refreshed tokens centrally if you want to avoid repeated token exchanges across runs.\\\\n\\\\n## Geocoding validation\\\\n- Orders ingestion stores `ship_geohash` alongside the raw record and writes `geocoded_ratio` into the ingestion summary.\\\\n- The helper `apps.worker.validation.geocoding.evaluate_geocoding_coverage` loads the latest orders snapshot, computes coverage, and persists a JSON report under `storage/metadata/state/geocoding/<tenant>.json`.\\\\n- Coverage results bubble into the PoC pipeline response (`geocoding_validation`) and inform context tags (e.g. `geo.partial`, `geo.missing`).\\\\n- Default threshold is 0.8; adjust per tenant if you expect higher sparsity.\\\\n\\\\n## Why Parquet + LakeWriter?\\\\n- Every ingestor writes via `LakeWriter.write_records(dataset, rows)`.\\\\n- Datasets live under `storage/lake/raw/<tenant_dataset>/<timestamp>.parquet`.\\\\n- Downstream tasks always load the **latest** snapshot for modelling.\\\\n\\\\n## Quick Recipe for a New Source\\\\n```python\\\\n@dataclass\\\\nclass MySourceIngestor(BaseIngestor):\\\\n    connector: MySourceConnector\\\\n\\\\n    async def ingest(self, tenant_id: str) -> IngestionSummary:\\\\n        payloads = await self.connector.fetch(...)\\\\n        rows = [self._normalise(item) for item in payloads]\\\\n        metrics = {\\\\\\\"geocoded_ratio\\\\\\\": 0.94}\\\\n        return self._write_records(\\\\n            f\\\\\\\"{tenant_id}_mysource\\\\\\\",\\\\n            rows,\\\\n            source=\\\\\\\"mysource_api\\\\\\\",\\\\n            metadata=metrics,\\\\n        )\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nKeep things boring and explicit—future contributors will have a much easier time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Weather Cache\\\\n- Weather fetches are keyed by tenant shipping geohashes (derived from order-level geocoding).\\\\n- Daily metrics stored under `storage/lake/weather/<geohash>/...json` with a running climatology in `climatology.parquet`.\\\\n- Anomalies are computed against day-of-year climatology so downstream models receive stationarised weather deltas.\\\\n- Rolling seven-day means (`temp_roll7`, `precip_roll7`) provide smoother signals for multi-geo aggregation.\\\\n- Feature builder expects columns `temp_c`, `precip_mm`, `temp_anomaly`, `precip_anomaly`, `temp_roll7`, `precip_roll7`.\\\\n- Schema validation runs via `shared.validation.schemas`.\\\\n\\\\n### Open-Meteo Daily Weather\\\\n\\\\n`WeatherCache.ensure_range` produces frames validated against `shared/contracts/weather_daily.schema.json`.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Notes |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `date` | string | UTC calendar date used for joins with other datasets |\\\\n| `local_date` | string | Local (timezone-aware) calendar date returned by Open-Meteo |\\\\n| `local_datetime` | string | Local midnight timestamp with timezone offset |\\\\n| `utc_datetime` | string | UTC timestamp corresponding to local midnight |\\\\n| `timezone` | string | IANA timezone identifier (e.g. `America/Los_Angeles`) |\\\\n| `geohash` | string | Precision `5` cell linking back to tenant geo |\\\\n| `temp_c`, `precip_mm` | number | Primary signals used downstream |\\\\n| `temp_anomaly`, `precip_anomaly` | number | Deviations vs climatology |\\\\n| `temp_roll7`, `precip_roll7` | number/null | Rolling seven-day means (null for the warmup window) |\\\\n| `*_lag1` columns | number/null | Previous-day values for leading indicators |\\\\n| `freeze_flag`, `heatwave_flag`, `snow_event_flag`, `high_wind_flag`, `uv_alert_flag`, `high_precip_prob_flag` | integer | Binary threshold events used in downstream feature builders |\\\\n| `observation_type` | string | `observed`, `forecast`, or `stub` provenance tag |\\\\n| `as_of_utc` | string | Timestamp when WeatherVane generated the blended row |\\\\n\\\\nDaily frames keep additional context columns (`temp_max_c`, `humidity_mean`, `uv_index_max`, etc.) so feature engineering can remain declarative.\\\\n\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}

Backfill tests, generate ensemble_metrics artifact, run required critics, and update docs before marking T4.1.4 complete.\\\\n\\\\n## Decisions\\\\n- Normalise time-series date columns inside apps/model/ts_training.py to accept Polars Date/Datetime inputs and fall back to DummyRegressor when the training window is too small.\\\\n- When extending forecast frames (apps/model/ensemble.py) coerce future rows to match existing schema so ensemble generation is robust in stub environments, and cast added rows before concatenation.\\\\n- Generated fresh ensemble metrics via apps/worker/run.py to hydrate experiments/forecast/ensemble_metrics.json.\\\\n\\\\n## Risks\\\\n- Forecast metrics presently derive from synthetic fallbacks; revisit with live weather feeds once API access is restored to validate non-zero ensembles.\\\\n\\\\n## Next Actions\\\\n- Monitor future runs of the PoC pipeline once real weather responses are available to confirm component weighting behaves as expected.\\\\n- Backfill richer synthetic revenue signals so ensemble quantiles exercise non-trivial paths before rolling into production tenants.\\\\n\\\\n## Decisions\\\\n- Implemented `apps.model.ensemble` to blend baseline, time-series, and naive components with holdout-aware weights and residual sampling for multi-horizon forecasts.\\\\n- Extended `apps.worker.flows.poc_pipeline.generate_ensemble_forecast` to emit ensemble diagnostics and persist `experiments/forecast/ensemble_metrics.json`.\\\\n- Added developer documentation at `docs/models/ensemble.md` covering component design and artifact wiring.\\\\n\\\\n## Risks\\\\nForecast extension currently forward-fills marketing features when generating future rows; if downstream planners expect scenario-specific spend, add hooks for allocator outputs to avoid stale assumptions.\\\\n\\\\n## Next actions\\\\n1. Wire allocator outputs or guardrails into the ensemble filler so future marketing features reflect planned budgets rather than forward-fill defaults.\\\\n2.
