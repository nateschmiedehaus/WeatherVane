Separate regressors are trained for treated and untreated observations, enabling us to predict the counterfactual outcome for every row and compute uplift as the difference between those predictions.\n+\n+## Data Requirements\n+\n+- Numeric outcome column (defaults to `net_revenue`).\n+- Binary treatment indicator column (defaults to `treatment`).\n+- One or more numerical feature columns; non-numeric or single-valued columns are automatically excluded.\n+- Enough rows per cohort (the model falls back to a mean regressor when fewer than 20 samples exist or when no usable features remain).\n+\n+The training entry point accepts a Polars `DataFrame` and handles cleaning (dropping rows with missing treatment/target values and casting to numeric types).\n+\n+## Training & Validation\n+\n+1. Split the cleaned dataset into training and validation sets using stratified sampling on the treatment flag.\n+2. Fit RandomForest regressors for the treatment and control cohorts independently (falling back to a `DummyRegressor` when data is sparse).\n+3. Generate predictions for both counterfactual outcomes on train and validation splits.\n+\n+The module reports:\n+\n+- Observed ATE (difference in actual means) for train/validation.\n+- Predicted ATE (mean predicted uplift) for train/validation.\n+- Cohort RMSE for train/validation.\n+- Qini AUC (uplift curve area minus randomized baseline).\n+- Segment level metrics for configurable top-percentile slices (top 10% and 25% by default).\n+\n+Validation previews contain sample rows with treatment flag, actual outcome, predicted treatment/control values, predicted uplift, and up to the first three feature values for fast debugging.\n+\n+## Artifact & CLI\n+\n+Running the synthetic harness (`python tools/generate_sample_uplift_report.py`) materialises a deterministic report at `experiments/causal/uplift_report.json`. This artifact powers causal QA and can be regenerated for bespoke datasets via:\n+\n+```bash\n+PYTHONPATH=.deps:. python tools/generate_sample_uplift_report.py\n+```\n+\n+The JSON payload includes configuration, dataset statistics, performance metrics, key segment summaries, and sample validation records.\n*** End Patch"}}

I’ll verify the status of docs/models/baseline.md to understand what’s going on with that directory."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABo6PYTu0tKDjK21BWJIfGuTk8zVASdqrj0RP7qg3PmxQ9ihczYLSfH4u6Za-mDKvBXJMYxZqLm6GFDIufD0uMggnSzzLumB0yDpKaTT3UIG0eHR1362zPOTv2ikdaD7Gxscyx0cglt9ER6u1E3siZ2MZPekjZU5LWli_44MD_uY-d4PQM9KAc7dwJmdfUYxgTHMQj7Rf7sDUkoDL1lSXCg7zSOhOXq-8gvlRXDNCmg1eAkoV6rj2TVOcyw7qkzEbb3lkufY6eSEqcdy5Vv7P6olF36eOZ4rklGY1OLdI14nfYI6tf8fDeRyI8p6ezOcJrKu6qQD2e3kMmt0xXmGXJardb0YG1NZou0yKMWtcnKL1i-EU3egGpdSairFYISvPnKZMEfufTQkdv3Zjs2WCufhd4ceFu8M0nVruTmDmbSlwcOOLF1pjbl7lqdx5umPuMgzRoNaTc1YOWrrn2SawZd0yPJbcAEK170dIXm8n-YcD_fuDYF9rqVee6947z0gJOy5cONTHvM8rdVXh_CkEaX_BIt2B60WtQ2YC2jAaNkJnoH7OhILtQArFH75q7TE6QrjVfBBA7aLx2V8ooxELDwSLXseo4h5S0YDk3LanMYtL3NVMmcs_SJvxtpv2wrvmlfpTmttOe3FtO8jlAbaXoFjjUgJnIJwDP2shZ1nKYEn_vxqklWeUdBoxPjyPWcT-ihgmbCyoQAC6p2BtWgm3dGE98VOopa864up8miDnVOwRL7GFUrCA7mDqr3TcTSFDxvMJHBNTdaFJhVotcZS77F3zDi58oxASec3laout0yZ4quu_UgbJJEa3AY2JQK8MOcL4Fg-FkvteHASrmcRDbstQ9JhT8udBA2_pXslAjf7apw55tTyf1XbSA2-MOHmNrVaT8L-KWQmKfQrCJpiixVPoFoAuqedOYqF3JA2Nf9xAM4koZiDkFI7gS1kTndDaxockJBDypOrUw6ccSuTfZefVf7dL8pdrZ4uRKXZ3ZcATX-VxIbCNIBHSRbVuWx5GrCS08yYLEronG2x2dIcYny5BxflsoJdDbRn39k5JAhzqTGwxwWSTVwoJFZYoVr0HU-q-SvdfLLIJwnWfkhpGtG7h4XocTkhiidzvpf30uC3stHac75Y49lJnwGNavkGIXJwkYlMvI6GCETFDesncwlSzYS8ozSdvGXnaCxDX1waPsYGOl72OgCa_dJhaCHWPreDifCxmrzAIWmxjZgFwCIAC7d11mX1L-T-3hy2qy0jEBTovnfuLDRdp5OTRa2UNa5zVaAM6L44CZMZWGhHMOg96CZqpZ5k_J5JXG6QuEtFdRvsaWLZg0b6ZRb4248xYKbg_GMuI85rsQ8YDhMGsc5UY3_WkG3HXGR9iiz1SesZCX0FXUUvQBZIxZYedRHCRnJyebgDZxdmkPkQvIm1qRr7dd-s5Hn0qUNez0YC8VsXELof7slqgFrcrrVCk1m1JDeL7LPQceQaA_ym2cLYHDjsVmBAExR8AoT7rEzG5NgM5Sqpmni8WVqmaQ0TeL8XKTiKeMdyhsqB2E8B3QCZLDzczrNojty1urZnvHxHGns-0owLqL8EU9bQDx559020SlGisnSlLw1coSKqLzSrhXjoqUsfjvVPdeT1dijmi-qY8NkMqJi4gykhNUpyM4oWrySQzJ9DpvD55mdzz__WRP1ZF8x_BPmOFnMOeUnMih5ZasSGPX99h5YTF7yo5lKMVG7yYNlLqztBXmx5990dMRZOYt8u9zoYDDJer3SDQ1_m4Pm_otG0ZprGegfIQJ4aSKvfw9faiTBS4qSpvlNGjMHDAxz5C_p6tFhNSmkGMunMVmj9A3XSePo4DR7X8yd-yTrBW4tEocfCVg7Ug5tYDZfdqodElAIfLdUaRQvYCnpwj80ddGrlbmqfsnsjEw9Ju9wGmvASnA731huHrim7kTp_xJ2UKzqOZvZzvZ372TbqkASq4uhR0Vt0w16L2h1b9tTunqNIlEppv4f1kK0PXIQVkBNd-ArAvevy733FoAaAh-HtkFMOfVDl5t5u6-ru_M7TOLdq5ik-8-wf4BeF_q4B8el7sQBxdegOtOZr65NPn6MV3qSOlbaZ_Xli7Kwd-O5JgM7cCczcrnBdBlZipu7HwYZ2c3zTC8Arrp4BlgkjgSO2XtoV3QEgo7u_rifUGEg6tBdvP0YpnKfluxi4zTev8EwfK8LJpJKRBmJEkzk7Tnsq0qXLidf1Bu9EW88zB1xvB5zRlO-RYBEKI_IcBfIz4XFsNkhj8eICYpN34qQIQovyARK7xunXdC2BEJ-kJom09y39wWIjhBA0yH36ws9G8eqC5Juh5iEqfKvPSj7ZQe9nvm1IVJKqBSIYCUAE21-2mnj89e2UoXegwSBxIJ6nF8ZMDgBhRPRKQSvloN8OAvawwuqE8C-W1WrgpTQymXzIJDDkQNLdPS3ZnD4uYKe7La1JWGEesU2LPaMY032OMP-3zSUDnZn6YfchTsYq0pCeBZW9OCDkP1LO-3V6XahwBWR48M5HBoiPW6PC2GzBG-fhcKbg864BHzQ7h5r4H17-N5gu0Yb-PExZ5eFi-8co_w9DyyQPfWdjRVnoPKNI_LXKLvDcllELCutz_e-f8k-Q5dLWqTR-_BRogA9V3ul7NTF_HIhKiJ9ZMDoa7m-82PPXwYLXgdgjOU_l5o-JeyF0cEscRC7ApV6BeZtMazLxgvqe4gdHABEB4z3y3zO7lUQmGOJKGiHyWoIg9NQkmz8SFyxqPcWmVgq6Xmo6IydXkrnGC1ETG5hbecHnYwDTzqZx4ZQWqmW618LbPTbhPjVTMSh9Bpm0-EmHMWhV5lYDLdhwhkkxztomH1H8YdUUudnK-z6A4VLHTYCVMJlb0htTrRs6flcpxE43bMobUFT7JmlmhMvmGTGy4dw2UD9joz74eqQmIvPQ1h7oZ3igVEKHa3B"}}

It anchors downstream allocators and benchmarking dashboards by capturing:\\\\n- Smooth non-linear responses to temperature and precipitation anomalies.\\\\n- Interactions between weather shifts and paid spend.\\\\n- Seasonality encoded in the feature store’s lag/rolling generators.\\\\n- Guardrails to avoid leakage, overfitting, and brittle coefficients when data is sparse.\\\\n\\\\n## Data Contract\\\\nInput matrices come from `shared.feature_store.FeatureBuilder` and must contain at minimum:\\\\n- `net_revenue` target.\\\\n- Weather columns: `temp_c`, `temp_anomaly`, `temp_roll7`, `precip_mm`, `precip_anomaly`, `precip_roll7`.\\\\n- Marketing intensity columns such as `*_spend`, `*_conversions`, or promo counts.\\\\nWe drop rows with nulls across the selected features and filter out degenerate columns (non-numeric or single unique value) before fitting.\\\\n\\\\n## Modelling Stack\\\\n1. **Primary learner – pyGAM LinearGAM**\\\\n   - Uses additive smoothers for every numeric feature (`s()` terms).\\\\n   - Weather signals receive higher spline capacity (up to 12 knots) to let the model capture threshold effects (e.g., heat domes, rain-outs).\\\\n   - Up to three tensor interaction terms (`te()`) couple weather and marketing spend so we can model scenario-dependent ROAS shifts.\\\\n   - Regularisation (`λ`) is tuned using a small log-spaced grid via `gam.gridsearch` with absolute-revenue weights (`|y|` clipped to ≥1) to stabilise heteroskedastic tenants.\\\\n   - If grid search struggles (e.g., collinear features), we retry with direct `gam.fit` and finally with a vanilla `LinearGAM` instance before conceding to the linear fallback.\\\\n   - Iterations capped at 200 to keep training deterministic in CI.\\\\n2. **Fallback – deterministic linear regression**\\\\n   - Engaged when pyGAM is unavailable or the dataset is too small (< `max(24, 4 * feature_count)` rows).\\\\n   - Solved with `numpy.linalg.lstsq` to maintain compatibility with legacy scaffolding tests.\\\\n   - Reverts to an intercept-only mean model when no usable features remain.\\\\n\\\\n## Evaluation Utilities\\\\n`evaluate_r2` recomputes R² on any Polars frame by replaying the GAM or linear coefficients. For GAMs we call `gam.predict` directly; the fallback path reconstructs predictions from the stored intercept and coefficients. Both branches drop rows with null targets to protect telemetry jobs.\\\\n\\\\n## Operational Considerations\\\\n- **Feature hygiene:** We explicitly require numeric dtypes and ≥2 distinct values per feature. This protects the GAM solver from singular basis matrices and keeps the linear fallback stable.\\\\n- **Leakage mitigation:** The upstream feature builder strips forecast/forward-looking rows. The baseline’s guardrails assume that invariant.\\\\n- **Explainability:** pyGAM supports partial dependence and marginal effects out of the box; we retain the fitted `gam` object in `BaselineModel` so future services can expose those diagnostics (e.g., via `gam.partial_dependence`).\\\\n- **Runtime:** The grid search and smoothers complete in <1s for typical 6–12 month daily slices in local testing. If longer runs arise, queue them with the heavy-job infra before productionising.\\\\n\\\\n## Training Pipeline\\\\nRun the dedicated trainer to fit and persist tenant-specific baselines:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npython -m apps.model.train TENANT_ID --end 2024-01-31 --lookback-days 365\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nKey flags:\\\\n- `--start/--end` – override lookback window (defaults to `end=today`, `start=end-lookback`).\\\\n- `--lake-root` – alternate storage mount when replaying experiments.\\\\n- `--output-root` – where to persist `baseline_model.pkl`, `metadata.json`, and optional `holdout_diagnostics.parquet`.\\\\n- `--run-id` – stable identifier for reproducible reruns.\\\\n\\\\nArtifacts captured under `storage/models/baseline/<tenant>/<run-id>/`:\\\\n- `baseline_model.pkl` – pickled `BaselineModel` retaining the fitted GAM for downstream scoring.\\\\n- `metadata.json` – diagnostics payload (window, guardrail status, training/holdout metrics, feature influence rankings, GAM usage reason).\\\\n- `holdout_diagnostics.parquet` – optional per-row holdout frame with predictions/residuals for monitoring.\\\\n\\\\nEvaluation protocol:\\\\n- Deterministic chronological split (80/20 with ≥14-day holdout) computed on leakage-sanitised observations.\\\\n- Metrics reported for training + holdout: R², MAE, RMSE, bias, and prediction spread.\\\\n- Feature influence derived from absolute correlation between predictions and each retained regressor to spotlight weather vs. marketing drivers.\\\\n- Guardrail metadata surfaces forward/forecast leakage removals so causal reviewers can audit drops before allocator hand-off.\\\\n\\\\n## Next Steps\\\\n1. Export marginal effects + confidence bands for UI and allocator introspection.\\\\n2. Layer in hierarchical pooling (geo × category) once tenant coverage broadens.\\\\n3. Extend interaction search to include humidity, wind, and promo cadence, gated by causal reviews.\\\\n\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}
