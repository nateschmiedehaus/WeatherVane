It anchors downstream allocators and benchmarking dashboards by capturing:\\\\n- Smooth non-linear responses to temperature and precipitation anomalies.\\\\n- Interactions between weather shifts and paid spend.\\\\n- Seasonality encoded in the feature store’s lag/rolling generators.\\\\n- Guardrails to avoid leakage, overfitting, and brittle coefficients when data is sparse.\\\\n\\\\n## Data Contract\\\\nInput matrices come from `shared.feature_store.FeatureBuilder` and must contain at minimum:\\\\n- `net_revenue` target.\\\\n- Weather columns: `temp_c`, `temp_anomaly`, `temp_roll7`, `precip_mm`, `precip_anomaly`, `precip_roll7`.\\\\n- Marketing intensity columns such as `*_spend`, `*_conversions`, or promo counts.\\\\nWe drop rows with nulls across the selected features and filter out degenerate columns (non-numeric or single unique value) before fitting.\\\\n\\\\n## Modelling Stack\\\\n1. **Primary learner – pyGAM LinearGAM**\\\\n   - Uses additive smoothers for every numeric feature (`s()` terms).\\\\n   - Weather signals receive higher spline capacity (up to 12 knots) to let the model capture threshold effects (e.g., heat domes, rain-outs).\\\\n   - Up to three tensor interaction terms (`te()`) couple weather and marketing spend so we can model scenario-dependent ROAS shifts.\\\\n   - Regularisation (`λ`) is tuned using a small log-spaced grid via `gam.gridsearch` with absolute-revenue weights (`|y|` clipped to ≥1) to stabilise heteroskedastic tenants.\\\\n   - Iterations capped at 200 to keep training deterministic in CI.\\\\n2. **Fallback – deterministic linear regression**\\\\n   - Engaged when pyGAM is unavailable or the dataset is too small (< `max(24, 4 * feature_count)` rows).\\\\n   - Solved with `numpy.linalg.lstsq` to maintain compatibility with legacy scaffolding tests.\\\\n   - Reverts to an intercept-only mean model when no usable features remain.\\\\n\\\\n## Evaluation Utilities\\\\n`evaluate_r2` recomputes R² on any Polars frame by replaying the GAM or linear coefficients. For GAMs we call `gam.predict` directly; the fallback path reconstructs predictions from the stored intercept and coefficients. Both branches drop rows with null targets to protect telemetry jobs.\\\\n\\\\n## Operational Considerations\\\\n- **Feature hygiene:** We explicitly require numeric dtypes and ≥2 distinct values per feature. This protects the GAM solver from singular basis matrices and keeps the linear fallback stable.\\\\n- **Leakage mitigation:** The upstream feature builder strips forecast/forward-looking rows. The baseline’s guardrails assume that invariant.\\\\n- **Explainability:** pyGAM supports partial dependence and marginal effects out of the box; we retain the fitted `gam` object in `BaselineModel` so future services can expose those diagnostics (e.g., via `gam.partial_dependence`).\\\\n- **Runtime:** The grid search and smoothers complete in <1s for typical 6–12 month daily slices in local testing. If longer runs arise, queue them with the heavy-job infra before productionising.\\\\n\\\\n## Next Steps\\\\n1. Export marginal effects + confidence bands for UI and allocator introspection.\\\\n2. Layer in hierarchical pooling (geo × category) once tenant coverage broadens.\\\\n3. Extend interaction search to include humidity, wind, and promo cadence, gated by causal reviews.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}

This protects the GAM solver from singular basis matrices and keeps the linear fallback stable.\n - **Leakage mitigation:** The upstream feature builder strips forecast/forward-looking rows. The baseline’s guardrails assume that invariant.\n - **Explainability:** pyGAM supports partial dependence and marginal effects out of the box; we retain the fitted `gam` object in `BaselineModel` so future services can expose those diagnostics (e.g., via `gam.partial_dependence`).\n - **Runtime:** The grid search and smoothers complete in <1s for typical 6–12 month daily slices in local testing. If longer runs arise, queue them with the heavy-job infra before productionising.\n+\n+## Training Pipeline\n+Run the dedicated trainer to fit and persist tenant-specific baselines:\n+\n+```bash\n+python -m apps.model.train TENANT_ID --end 2024-01-31 --lookback-days 365\n+```\n+\n+Key flags:\n+- `--start/--end` – override lookback window (defaults to `end=today`, `start=end-lookback`).\n+- `--lake-root` – alternate storage mount when replaying experiments.\n+- `--output-root` – where to persist `baseline_model.pkl`, `metadata.json`, and optional `holdout_diagnostics.parquet`.\n+- `--run-id` – stable identifier for reproducible reruns.\n+\n+Artifacts captured under `storage/models/baseline/<tenant>/<run-id>/`:\n+- `baseline_model.pkl` – pickled `BaselineModel` retaining the fitted GAM for downstream scoring.\n+- `metadata.json` – diagnostics payload (window, guardrail status, training/holdout metrics, feature influence rankings, GAM usage reason).\n+- `holdout_diagnostics.parquet` – optional per-row holdout frame with predictions/residuals for monitoring.\n+\n+Evaluation protocol:\n+- Deterministic chronological split (80/20 with ≥14-day holdout) computed on leakage-sanitised observations.\n+- Metrics reported for training + holdout: R², MAE, RMSE, bias, and prediction spread.\n+- Feature influence derived from absolute correlation between predictions and each retained regressor to spotlight weather vs. marketing drivers.\n+- Guardrail metadata surfaces forward/forecast leakage removals so causal reviewers can audit drops before allocator hand-off.\n \n ## Next Steps\n 1. Export marginal effects + confidence bands for UI and allocator introspection.\n 2. Layer in hierarchical pooling (geo × category) once tenant coverage broadens.\n 3. Extend interaction search to include humidity, wind, and promo cadence, gated by causal reviews.\n*** End Patch"}}

synthetic fixtures fall back to linear, so confirm GAM execution on a fuller tenant before allocator assumptions rely on splines.\\\\n- Polars warns about `NUMERIC_DTYPES` deprecation; track a migration to `polars.selectors` to avoid future breaks.\\\\n\\\\n## Next actions\\\\n- Run critics: build, tests, manager_self_check, data_quality, design_system, org_pm, exec_review, health_check, human_sync, plus causal and academic_rigor for T2.2.1.\\\\n- Plumb the trainer into worker orchestration/Make targets for repeatable CI retraining.\\\\n- Capture marginal effect exports in a follow-up to unlock allocator visualisations.\\\\n\\\\n## Current Focus\\\\nT2.2.1 – hardening the weather-aware GAM baseline so pyGAM fits succeed in CI, updating docs, and staging roadmap closure once validation is unblocked.\\\\n\\\\n## Decisions\\\\n- Added multi-strategy GAM fitter (grid search → direct fit → vanilla LinearGAM) to recover from collinearity/solver hiccups before falling back to linear regression.\\\\n\\\\n## Risks\\\\n- Local Python runtime still crashes on `numpy` import, blocking pytest/critics execution; need confirmation on a sane CI node before shipping.\\\\n\\\\n## Next Actions\\\\n- Attempt critics/tests again once numpy wheel issue is resolved or alternative environment is available.\\\\n- If critics pass upstream, mark T2.2.1 done and proceed to allocator follow-up tasks.\\\\n\\\\n## Roadmap Snapshot (truncated)\\\\n```yaml\\\\nepics:\\\\n  - id: E1\\\\n    title: Epic 1 — Ingest & Weather Foundations\\\\n    description: Stand up weather + marketing ingestion, harmonise geo/time, and\\\\n      validate data quality.\\\\n    milestones:\\\\n      - id: M1.1\\\\n        title: Connector scaffolding\\\\n        tasks:\\\\n          - id: T1.1.1\\\\n            title: Design Open-Meteo + Shopify connectors and data contracts\\\\n            owner: WVO\\\\n            estimate_hours: 6\\\\n            status: done\\\\n            exit_criteria:\\\\n              - critic: build\\\\n              - critic: tests\\\\n              - doc: docs/INGESTION.md\\\\n          - id: T1.1.2\\\\n            title: Implement ingestion Prefect flow with checkpointing\\\\n            owner: WVO\\\\n            estimate_hours: 8\\\\n            status: done\\\\n            dependencies:\\\\n              - T1.1.1\\\\n            exit_criteria:\\\\n              - critic: data_quality\\\\n              - critic: org_pm\\\\n              - artifact: experiments/ingest/dq_report.json\\\\n      - id: M1.2\\\\n        title: Weather harmonisation\\\\n        tasks:\\\\n          - id: T1.2.1\\\\n            title: Blend historical + forecast weather, enforce timezone alignment\\\\n            owner: WVO\\\\n            estimate_hours: 6\\\\n            status: done\\\\n            exit_criteria:\\\\n              - critic: forecast_stitch\\\\n              - doc: docs/weather/blending.md\\\\n          - id: T1.2.2\\\\n            title: Add leakage guardrails to feature builder\\\\n            owner: WVO\\\\n            estimate_hours: 4\\\\n            status: done\\\\n            dependencies:\\\\n              - T1.2.1\\\\n            exit_criteria:\\\\n              - critic: leakage\\\\n              - critic: tests\\\\n  - id: E2\\\\n    title: Epic 2 — Features & Modeling Baseline\\\\n    description: Ship lagged features, baseline models, and evaluation harness.\\\\n    milestones:\\\\n      - id: M2.1\\\\n        title: Feature pipeline\\\\n        tasks:\\\\n          - id: T2.1.1\\\\n            title: Build lag/rolling feature generators with deterministic seeds\\\\n            owner: WVO\\\\n            estimate_hours: 6\\\\n            status: done\\\\n            exit_criteria:\\\\n              - critic: build\\\\n              - critic: tests\\\\n              - critic: data_quality\\\\n      - id: M2.2\\\\n        title: Baseline modeling\\\\n        tasks:\\\\n          - id: T2.2.1\\\\n            title: Train weather-aware GAM baseline and document methodology\\\\n            owner: WVO\\\\n            estimate_hours: 8\\\\n            status: pending\\\\n            exit_criteria:\\\\n              - critic: causal\\\\n              - critic: academic_rigor\\\\n              - doc: docs/models/baseline.md\\\\n  - id: E3\\\\n    title: Epic 3 — Allocation & UX\\\\n    description: Allocator robustness checks, dashboards, and UI polish.\\\\n    milestones:\\\\n      - id: M3.1\\\\n        title: Allocator guardrails\\\\n        tasks:\\\\n          - id: T3.1.1\\\\n            title: Implement budget allocator stress tests and regret bounds\\\\n            owner: WVO\\\\n            estimate_hours: 7\\\\n            status: done\\\\n            exit_criteria:\\\\n              - critic: allocator\\\\n              - critic: cost_perf\\\\n              - artifact: experiments/policy/regret.json\\\\n      - id: M3.2\\\\n        title: Dashboard + UX review\\\\n        tasks:\\\\n          - id: T3.2.1\\\\n            title: Run design system critic and ensure accessibility coverage\\\\n            owner: WVO\\\\n            estimate_hours: 5\\\\n            status: done\\\\n            exit_criteria:\\\\n              - critic: design_system\\\\n              - critic: exec_review\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}
