Web Inspiration Feature (NOT FORCED)\\n\\n**Status:** Opt-in via environment variable\\n\\n```bash\\n# autopilot.sh:36\\nWVO_ENABLE_WEB_INSPIRATION=${WVO_ENABLE_WEB_INSPIRATION:-0}  # Defaults to OFF\\n```\\n\\n**Inefficiency Found:**\\n- `WebInspirationManager` is **always instantiated** even when disabled (orchestrator_runtime.ts:48-52)\\n- `ensureInspiration()` is **called for every task** (agent_coordinator.ts:192), though it exits early if disabled\\n\\n**Impact:** Low (exits early), but wastes initialization cycles\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Lazy-load or conditionally instantiate based on env var\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Token Efficiency (WELL-DESIGNED)\\n\\n**Context Assembly Strategy** (agent_coordinator.ts:499-544):\\n```typescript\\n// Multi-tier fallback to maximize context while staying under token limits\\nstrategies = [\\n  { includeCodeContext: true, maxDecisions: 6, maxLearnings: 3, hoursBack: 24 },\\n  { includeCodeContext: true, maxDecisions: 4, maxLearnings: 2, hoursBack: 12 },\\n  { includeCodeContext: true, maxDecisions: 3, maxLearnings: 2, hoursBack: 12 },\\n  { includeCodeContext: false, maxDecisions: 2, maxLearnings: 1, hoursBack: 6 }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n✅ **This is excellent** - progressively reduces context until it fits under 32K character limit\\n\\n**Snapshot Throttling** (operations_manager.ts:206-208):\\n```typescript\\n// Max 1 snapshot per 2 seconds prevents expensive recomputation\\nif (now - this.lastSnapshotTime < this.SNAPSHOT_THROTTLE_MS && this.lastSnapshot) {\\n  return;  // Use cached snapshot\\n}\\n```\\n\\n✅ **This is excellent** - prevents redundant expensive operations\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. No Other Forced Features\\n\\nAudited for forced behaviors:\\n- ❌ No forced screenshot capture\\n- ❌ No forced web fetching\\n- ❌ No forced heavy operations\\n- ✅ All critics are opt-in via `critics_run` tool\\n- ✅ Capability profiles (low/medium/high) properly control resource usage\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations for Maximum Efficiency\\n\\n### Immediate Fixes\\n\\n**1. Lazy-load WebInspirationManager** (orchestrator_runtime.ts)\\n\\n```typescript\\n// BEFORE (current)\\nthis.webInspirationManager = new WebInspirationManager(\\n  workspaceRoot,\\n  this.stateMachine,\\n  this.operationsManager\\n);\\n\\n// AFTER (conditional)\\nthis.webInspirationManager = process.env.WVO_ENABLE_WEB_INSPIRATION === '1'\\n  ? new WebInspirationManager(workspaceRoot, this.stateMachine, this.operationsManager)\\n  : undefined;\\n```\\n\\n**2. Skip ensureInspiration call entirely when disabled** (agent_coordinator.ts:192)\\n\\n```typescript\\n// BEFORE (current)\\nawait this.webInspirationManager?.ensureInspiration(task);\\n\\n// AFTER (conditional check before call)\\nif (this.webInspirationManager?.isEnabled()) {\\n  await this.webInspirationManager.ensureInspiration(task);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Savings:** Eliminates function call overhead for every task execution\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Long-term Optimizations\\n\\n**3. Add telemetry for token usage tracking**\\n- Currently using character-based estimation (4 chars = 1 token)\\n- Consider actual token counting for precise budget management\\n\\n**4. Cache expensive operations more aggressively**\\n- Quality monitor evaluations could be cached per git commit SHA\\n- Context assembly could use content-addressed caching\\n\\n**5. Profile-based feature flags**\\n```typescript\\ninterface ProfileConfig {\\n  enableWebInspiration: boolean;\\n  enableClaudeEval: boolean;\\n  snapshotThrottleMs: number;\\n  maxContextStrategies: number;\\n}\\n\\nconst PROFILES: Record<'low' | 'medium' | 'high', ProfileConfig> = {\\n  low: {\\n    enableWebInspiration: false,\\n    enableClaudeEval: false,\\n    snapshotThrottleMs: 5000,\\n    maxContextStrategies: 2  // Only try 2 fallback strategies\\n  },\\n  medium: {\\n    enableWebInspiration: false,  // Still opt-in via env\\n    enableClaudeEval: true,\\n    snapshotThrottleMs: 2000,\\n    maxContextStrategies: 4\\n  },\\n  high: {\\n    enableWebInspiration: true,\\n    enableClaudeEval: true,\\n    snapshotThrottleMs: 1000,\\n    maxContextStrategies: 4\\n  }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Current Efficiency Scorecard\\n\\n| Category | Rating | Notes |\\n|----------|--------|-------|\\n| Token Management | ✅ Excellent | Multi-tier context fallback, 32K char limit |\\n| Snapshot Throttling | ✅ Excellent | 2-second throttle prevents redundant work |\\n| Lazy Loading | ⚠️ Needs Work | WebInspirationManager always instantiated |\\n| Feature Forcing | ✅ Good | No features are forced; all opt-in |\\n| Caching Strategy | ✅ Good | Auth cache (15min TTL), MCP registry cache |\\n| Context Assembly | ✅ Excellent | Progressive reduction until fits budget |\\n\\n---\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.5}}"}}

Operate Codex-only (no Claude fallback) until the CLI story stabilises.\\n\\n### WeatherVane Product (domain: product)\\n- Drive connector-readiness for Meta and Google so the allocator can progress from read-only plans to guarded pushes.\\n- Finish the weather hardening stream: unblock and close T7.1.2 once the leakage critic runs, then tackle schema validation and pipeline robustness (T7.1.3/T7.2.x).\\n- Keep shipping vertical slices (allocator, RL shadow, creative guardrails) while monitoring pending critics for capability unlocks.\\n- 2025-10-13: Documented ad push preflight diff architecture (`docs/api/ad_push_preflight_diff.md`) covering API surface, worker responsibilities, guardrail evaluation, and artifact contract for T5.3.1.\\n\\n## Guardrails & System Decisions\\n- MCP command execution is locked behind an allow-list (`isCommandAllowed` before `ensureCommandSafe`); pytest + Vitest suites enforce no chaining or substitution slips.\\n- All MCP requests stamp correlation IDs through the state machine, telemetry, and orchestration logs to keep blue/green upgrades traceable.\\n- Prompt composition defaults to compact JSON evidence packs (`formatForPromptCompact`), with `WVO_PROMPT_MODE=verbose` as the rollback lever.\\n- Coordinator failover surfaces in `orchestrator_status`, execution telemetry, and a guardrail script that checks Codex share, downtime, and telemetry freshness.\\n- Meta Marketing API now has a first-class client (`MetaMarketingClient`) supporting campaign/ad-set/ad/creative creation with sane defaults, UTC scheduling, and payload validation.\\n\\n## Risks\\n- Provider CLI footers may change; add smoke checks so failover telemetry does not break silently.\\n- TypeScript build is not exercised in this sandbox—use `npm run build --prefix tools/wvo_mcp` before packaging releases.\\n- Prompt token-pressure heuristics rely on rolling averages; spikes may breach limits until the window settles.\\n- Sandbox blocks outbound network calls; coordinator reports `network_offline` until connectivity returns.\\n\\n## Next actions\\n### MCP Platform (domain: mcp)\\n- Keep an eye on MCP guardrails (failover, command allow-list, compact evidence packs); patch regressions quickly but do not reopen PHASE‑5 optimisation until the E6/E10 bundle is locked.\\n- Close out the E6 + E10 joint upgrade plan: create consolidated design doc, align task owners, and schedule the flag/rollback/self-check automation as a single release train.\\n- Stage PHASE‑5A deliverables (caching, batch queue, strict validation, idempotency, telemetry spans) so they are ready to ship immediately after the upgrade bundle; document that sandbox pooling and FTS5 search remain PHASE‑5B and depend on E5.\\n- Only pivot to `domain: 'mcp'` tasks when product work is blocked or explicitly scheduled; use `plan_next` filters to confirm the product queue is clear first.\\n- Re-evaluate domain choice on every loop, even mid-sequence—there is no \\\"sticky\\\" MCP priority.\\n- 2025-10-15: Implement the consensus engine scaffolding (T3.3.2 Phase 1) and pipe decision artifacts into `context_entries` before dispatching high-risk work. Telemetry + simulation harness are live; next up is wiring additional proposal sources.\\n\\n### WeatherVane Product (domain: product)\\n- Pull the highest-priority WeatherVane tasks via `plan_next` (E1 ingestion foundations, allocator follow-ups, web UX) and ship vertical slices with critics once weather leakage testing clears.\\n- When calling `plan_next`, use `filters: { domain: 'product' }` by default so the queue surfaces WeatherVane work before MCP items.\\n- Wire the Meta marketing client into automation flows (diff visualiser, approvals, rollback playbooks).\\n- Confirm Epic 1 artifacts stay current after flipping roadmap status to done; schedule light regression sweep if ingestion contracts change.\\n- Re-run `plan_next` before starting each new slice; do not assume the previous domain still holds.\\n- If exit criteria are blocked on critics/tests that currently can’t run, record the blocker (task memo + plan_update), keep the task in `blocked`, and park the work instead of creating fallback “sign-off” docs.\\n- 2025-10-15: Marked T3.3.2–T3.3.4 as `blocked` because the design_system critic remains skipped under the current capability profile; awaiting capability restore before resuming M3.3/M3.4.\\n### Autopilot Captain Persona — Atlas & Director Dana\\n- Re-evaluate domain choice on every loop, even mid-sequence—there is no \\\"sticky\\\" MCP priority.\\n- Audit the roadmap weekly: ensure both WeatherVane product (domain=`product`) and MCP platform (domain=`mcp`) are balanced, with M3.3/M3.4 implementation work scheduled before celebrating UX wins.\\n- Listen for design critiques, product gaps, and ROI shortfalls; if the roadmap lacks concrete product implementation (pages, dashboards, flows), add or prioritise the corresponding M3.3/M3.4 tasks before celebrating success.\\n- Treat exit criteria as immutable contracts: if critics or reviewers are missing, leave the task blocked and escalate the capability gap instead of rubber-stamping completion. When a critic raises issues or new work, capture them as explicit roadmap tasks and deliver the required edits. Atlas can call on Directorial Dana when issues cascade.\\n- If critics repeatedly skip due to capability limits, log a task in E6/E10 to restore the capability before unblocking dependent product work.\\n- Guarantee connectivity: run Network Navigator at session start; if it fails, restart MCP with `make mcp-autopilot danger=1` so both Codex and Claude operate with unrestricted network access.\\n- Champion exceptional craft: elevate WeatherVane UX, narrative, and ROI storytelling until they meet Atlas' world-class benchmark.\\n- Log every consensus decision (once enabled) back into `state/context.md` so Org PM + Manager Self Check critics stay in sync with live governance.\\n\\n### Critic Personas (alliterative aliases)\\n- **Academic Rigor** → Scholar Sage\\n- **Allocator** → Allocator Alex\\n- **Build** → Builder Bailey\\n- **Causal** → Causal Casey\\n\\n_Trimmed for token efficiency (startup); full history preserved in `state/backups/context/context-2025-10-15T22-29-40-745Z.md`._\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.5}}"}}
