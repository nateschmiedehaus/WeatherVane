# WeatherVane Demo Plan — "Sky to Sale" Tour

## Overview
Position the flagship demo as the fastest path from storm alert to campaign launch. Restate the value proposition in every chapter: WeatherVane turns volatile weather into marketing advantage within minutes, not days. The narrative places a retail marketer in the spotlight as they use the platform to orchestrate responses through a blizzard week.

## Choreography
1. **Hook** — 30 seconds. Presenter cites real revenue impact while a weather-driven insight animation plays on the hero screen.
2. **Setup Time Proof** — Under three minutes to connect Shopify, Meta Ads, and Snowflake. We feature a timer overlay to reinforce setup time and remove doubts about integration complexity.
3. **Scenario Studio** — Two minutes. The user assembles the "Arctic Flash Sale" story, adjusts pacing via sliders, and attaches suggested creative derived from inspiration analysis.
4. **Automation Launchpad** — Ninety seconds. Demo flow highlights the toggles that push changes live, referencing guardrails documented in the integration matrix.
5. **Executive Recap** — One minute. Present the executive summary, ROI projections, and a direct call to action for leadership to approve the plan.

## Weather-Driven Insight Moments
- Lightning overlay indicates a sudden supply chain risk.
- Animated snowfall demonstrates creative swaps and messaging variations.
- Real-time chart reveals how the weather-driven insight correlates to conversion lift.

## Conversion Close
Immediately after the recap, the host triggers the payment modal. The demo flow must surface a tailored call to action and cross-link to the pricing sheet. We show analytics instrumentation capturing the event to reassure the audience that conversion tracking is wired before they pay. Include a soft fallback for procurement-driven buyers: "Schedule enterprise discussion".

## Demo Toolkit
- Motion prototypes in Framer for every transition.
- Annotated screenshots for the Atmosphere Conductor theme.
- Scripted voiceover aligning with the stakeholder narrative.
- Checklist ensuring weather animation remains synchronized with live data.

## Follow-up
Close by reasserting the value proposition and inviting the audience to explore the immersive sandbox. Provide links to the inspiration catalog, responsive testing evidence, and the stakeholder narrative so the buyer sees holistic excellence.
This demo choreography is mirrored in the rehearsal checklist stored alongside motion captures so every presenter stays perfectly aligned.
