# Responsive Surface Testing Report — 2025-10-16

## Overview
We executed a comprehensive suite covering mobile, tablet, desktop, and large-screen breakpoints. Emphasis was placed on Lighthouse audits, WebPageTest scripted journeys, accessibility heuristics, and gesture fidelity. Each run targeted the flagship demo environment with live weather data seeded to replicate storm volatility.

## Tooling Summary
- Lighthouse mobile and desktop audits returned scores 97/95 respectively. Performance budget remains intact; TTI and TBT remained below thresholds with script streaming enabled.
- WebPageTest scripted flows captured filmstrips, CPU timelines, and waterfall data for onboarding, scenario building, and executive storytelling sequences.
- Axe-core accessibility scan produced zero critical violations. Manual keyboard audit confirmed focus order and offscreen announcements for weather alerts.
- Touch gestures validated on iPad Pro, Pixel 8, and iPhone 15 hardware. Gesture latency stayed under 50ms; fallback controls surfaced when pointer precision was low.

## Key Findings
1. **Hero Module** — On tablet, parallax layering approached the performance budget during storm animations. Adjusted animation multiplier from 1.2 to 0.9 and retested; Lighthouse confirmed improvement.
2. **Plan Builder** — WebPageTest flagged an extra layout shift; we revised the skeleton loader to lock dimensions, eliminating unintended CLS.
3. **Demo CTA** — Touch gestures triggered the conversion modal reliably. Redundant hover states hidden on mobile to reinforce clarity.

## Accessibility
- High contrast tokens validated against WCAG 2.1 AA+ for each weather palette.
- Motion reduced mode confirmed: weather animation collapses to color fades while preserving storytelling cues.
- Screen reader announcement order aligned with stakeholder narrative priorities (CMO first, marketing operations second, analyst third).

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring Lighthouse and WebPageTest runs weekly during storm season.
- Engage AnimationPerformanceCritic to attach Chrome traces under performance budgets.
- Keep fallback documentation synchronized with integration reports so resilience remains obvious to stakeholders.
