Each prototype captures the flagship interactions discussed in the motion specs. Frames include instrumented performance overlays and comments noting how the framer motion components translate to production. The Lottie export demonstrates the snow-to-storm transition with crunch-free gradients, and the After Effects composition documents texturing that informs on-canvas shaders.
