# Integration Test Report â€” 2025-10-16

## Scope
- Weather API contract testing across Open-Meteo and NOAA experimental endpoints.
- Marketing automation contract testing for Meta Ads and Google Ads.
- Payments flow regression to validate Stripe webhook handling.
- Analytics pipeline verification including Snowflake + Databricks synchronization.

## Tooling & Results
- Postman collection executed nightly via CI with synthetic weather payloads; all assertions passed.
- Pact-based contract testing validated schema compatibility for marketing automations and analytics ingestion layers.
- Integration CLI replays webhooks using recorded fixtures; zero failures observed.
- Resilience drill simulated partial outages by disabling marketing APIs and verifying retry logic.
- Alerts pipeline confirmed via synthetic incidents: PagerDuty triggered within 90 seconds when error budget exceeded.

## Follow-ups
1. Expand contract testing coverage for payments chargebacks by end of week.
2. Document additional resilience drills covering combined weather + marketing degradation.
3. Ensure alerts remain actionable for operations teams and include context captured in state/context.md.
