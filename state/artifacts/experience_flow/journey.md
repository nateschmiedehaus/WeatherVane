# WeatherVane Flagship Journey

## Awareness
WeatherVane leads with a cinematic hero scene that fuses live radar data, predictive copy, and a hook for marketers seeking storm-ready campaigns. The awareness moment anchors around a weather insight ticker that updates every sixty seconds and pairs a headline about impending weather shifts with a case study from a peer brand. Strategic copy makes the weather signal tangible and tees up the downstream scenario planning. The experience flow intentionally draws a line between climate volatility and marketing spend so the prospective user immediately connects the product to revenue outcomes.

## Onboarding
The onboarding sequence layers progressive disclosure with contextual weather insights. The user is welcomed by a concierge card referencing the current forecast in their top geo. Tooltips introduce the plan builder, inventory snapshots, and pre-built automation templates. We combine short form motion loops with explanatory text to keep the flow energetic while respecting accessibility states. Each step ends with an explicit commitment to unlock a more personalized weather insight if the user completes the profile questions.

## Scenario Planning
The scenario phase presents a storyboard of three weather-driven opportunities with ROI estimates. It highlights channel-by-channel guidance, recommended creative, and supply chain guardrails. The interface includes a weather animation timeline that rewinds to previous events to build trust in the forecasting engine. Collaborators can attach notes, approve automations, or duplicate the plan for regional teams. We emphasize team rituals—daily standups, executive reviews, and service alerts—so the scenario flow acts as the heartbeat for cross-functional coordination.

## Execution
Execution combines a command center layout with automation toggles. The primary callouts show channel health, active campaigns, and forecast deviations. Weather insight panels surface the probability of key events and present the recommended adjustments with one-click approvals. To sustain momentum, contextual guidance cards cite the inspiration catalog and note which creative assets align with the current weather state. The execution section also records any manual overrides and packages them for later retrospectives.

## Follow-up
The journey concludes with a follow-up ritual that includes a retrospective template, analytics exports, and executive storytelling assets. Automated insights tell the story of lift vs control groups, broken down by channel and persona. The system writes draft updates for the CMO, marketing operations, and analyst personas. The follow-up emphasizes how weather insight loops back into inventory planning and media decisions. Each retrospective entry links to the inspiration source, motion prototype, and stakeholder narrative to prove that the WeatherVane experience is holistic and continuously improving.

By weaving awareness, onboarding, scenario, execution, and follow-up into a single thread anchored by weather insight, the journey document guarantees the experience remains orchestral and revenue focused.
