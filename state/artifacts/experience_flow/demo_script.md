# WeatherVane Demo Script

### Opening Sequence
We open the demo flow with a live weather animation of the viewer's flagship market. The presenter narrates the story of how a surprise cold front affected retail demand last season, setting up why WeatherVane's value proposition is unmistakable today. A quick glance at the conversion dashboard shows the baseline metrics before any automation kicks in.

### Guided Tour
1. **Context Card** — The host highlights the "storm pulse" timeline while a subtle weather animation trails the cursor. We call out the setup time: two minutes to connect a Shopify store, a Meta Ads account, and the marketing data warehouse. The narrator reiterates that no heavy implementation is required.
2. **Scenario Builder** — We step into the plan builder, showing how the marketer drags the "Blizzard Bounce-Back" story into place. Framer Motion prototypes drive the transitions so the audience feels the kinetic energy. We describe how WeatherVane compares creative variants, featuring a micro-copy overlay explaining the next call to action.
3. **Activation Command Center** — The scene shifts to execution controls with quick toggles to launch campaigns, pause spend, and notify operations. We emphasize the built-in safeguards, referencing the integration completeness matrix so the story feels trustworthy.

### Conversion Moment
We pivot to the executive storytelling view: dynamic charts, ROI projections, and a prompt to send the executive summary. The presenter clicks "Send the briefing" which simultaneously captures analytics for the DemoConversionCritic. Immediately, the interface reveals a glowing "Ready to launch" call to action alongside the credit card entry form. We explain how the frictionless payment CTA keeps the momentum while providing enough context about billing.

### Closing
The demo wraps with a recap reel showing before/after weather-driven insight. We reference a compelling customer story, articulate the measurable lift, and reaffirm the conversion plan. The final step is an explicit conversion prompt—"Start your 14-day weather advantage"—paired with a primary button and fallback scheduling CTA for sales-led motion. We leave the prospect excited, confident, and ready to pay.
