# Inspiration Analysis — Flagship Experience Refresh

## Sources Reviewed
- Framer "Climate Core" template — Cinematic temporal layering for hero states.
- Webflow "Storm Atlas" showcase — Fluid storytelling with pinned navigation.
- Awwwards "Aurora Index" winner — Scrollytelling with ambient soundscapes.
- SiteInspire "Tide Instruments" curation — Monolith layout with subtle physics.
- Lottie library loops for precipitation overlays.

## Synthesis
Framer demonstrates how motion language can communicate urgency without overwhelming the user. We map its timeline pacing into our plan builder interactions, prioritizing easing curves that maintain 60fps even when overlays animate. The Webflow showcase highlights modular blocks that translate to our responsive surface needs; we draw direct parallels to the hero offset grid and the sticky executive summary.

Awwwards entries pushed us toward bolder color theory. We extracted gradient strategies for storm transitions and applied them to the Atmosphere Conductor theme tokens. SiteInspire examples confirmed that calm, minimalist states still benefit from nuanced interaction cue design—small hover reveals, micro delays, and tactile card stacking.

## Application to WeatherVane
1. **Hero Narrative** — Combined Framer and Webflow learnings to script a hero timeline that syncs with live weather data. Motion language emphasises the pivot from awareness to onboarding.
2. **Scenario Cards** — Color theory from Awwwards entries inspired our new storm palette (#040814 base with magenta accents) and improved text legibility.
3. **Interaction Cues** — Borrowed SiteInspire gesture pattern to gently guide analysts toward deeper insights with icon micro-movements.

## Next Moves
- Catalog new references weekly and expand `state/web_inspiration` with annotated screenshots.
- Ensure every inspiration capture links back to design decisions so InspirationCoverageCritic sees the chain of custody from source to execution.
- Document how the inspiration set influences the demo choreography and stakeholder storytelling so the narrative stays cohesive across teams.
