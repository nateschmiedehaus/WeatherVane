              Requirements:
                - Show operators exactly what WeatherVane changed or recommends changing, with clear “what/why/next” messaging.
                - Remove jargon (“guardrail”, “triage”) in favour of user-facing language (e.g., “Overspend alert”, “Weather action”).
                - Keep first view scannable: one hero recommendation, secondary cards, optional detail drill-down.
              Standards:
                - Copy: conversational, action-oriented, no internal terminology.
                - UX: minimalist layout, responsive to desktop/tablet, accessible (WCAG AA).
                - Engineering: Playwright smoke must pass; analytics instrumentation preserved; Vitest coverage for helpers.
              Implementation Plan:
                - Draft/record design brief in docs/UX_CRITIQUE.md.
                - Refactor hero + summary components around new copy and layout.
                - Update analytics helpers/tests, run Vitest + Playwright.
                - Capture iteration in state/context.md with screenshots and critic notes.
              Deliverables:
                - Updated React/CSS modules under apps/web/src/pages/dashboard.tsx and styles.
                - Revised helper libraries/tests (apps/web/src/lib/**, tests/web/**).
                - Playwright report + screenshots stored under state/artifacts/ui/weatherops.
              Integration Points:
                - API suggestion telemetry (shared/services/dashboard_analytics_ingestion.py) ensuring copy aligns with payload fields.
                - Analytics events (`trackDashboardEvent`) and downstream dashboards; coordinate with data/ML owners if field names change.
                - Worker-generated suggestion summaries (apps/worker/flows/poc_pipeline.py) to maintain consistency across channels.
              Evidence:
                - Playwright run ID + html report.
                - design_system + exec_review critic outputs (once available).
                - Context entry summarising decisions, open questions, next iteration.

              Requirements:
                - Explain every autonomous change in plain language (what changed, when, why, impact).
                - Provide explicit approval/rollback affordances for humans and highlight pending reviews.
                - Surface evidence (metrics, weather context, spend forecasts) inline or a click away.
              Standards:
                - Copy: transparent, confidence-building, avoids “audit/guardrail” jargon.
                - UX: timeline or table must prioritise newest changes, support filtering; accessible controls for approvals.
                - Engineering: tests updated (Vitest, Playwright), telemetry preserved, change log data schema documented.
                - ML context (if applicable): explain model confidence/reason codes clearly.
              Implementation Plan:
                - Extend docs/UX_CRITIQUE.md with Automations brief, list user questions + acceptance metrics.
                - Redesign components/layout in apps/web/src/pages/automations.tsx; integrate evidence panels.
                - Update helpers/tests, run Vitest + Playwright, capture critics.
                - Log iterations in state/context.md with before/after screenshots and open questions.
              Deliverables:
                - Updated Automations page/components/styles.
                - Supporting helper modules/tests (automationInsights, validation, etc.).
                - Evidence artifacts (Playwright report, screenshots, context notes).
              Integration Points:
                - Automation audit APIs/events (apps/api/services/dashboard_service.py, shared schemas) so reason codes remain synchronized.
                - Worker automation execution logs (`apps/worker/flows/**`) and telemetry exports consumed by directors/Dana.
                - Notification channels or forthcoming approval workflows (e.g., Slack/email) to ensure new statuses map correctly.
              Evidence:
                - Playwright run + report stored under state/artifacts/ui/automations.
                - design_system + exec_review critic confirmation.
                - Context log summarising decisions, trade-offs, next steps.
