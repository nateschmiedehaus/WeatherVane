      domain: product
      description: 'Enhance roadmap.yaml structure to be more machine-readable and
        autopilot-friendly. Current structure is human-optimized (YAML prose); autopilot
        needs typed schemas, explicit dependencies, machine-readable success criteria,
        and metadata for intelligent task selection.

        Improvements: 1. Define TypeScript schemas (TaskSchema, EpicSchema, MilestoneSchema)
        2. Add typed dependency relationships (depends_on, blocks, related_to, produces,
        consumes) 3. Structure acceptance criteria as testable predicates (not prose)
        4. Add autopilot metadata (complexity: 1-10, effort_hours, risk_level, tool_allowlist)
        5. Enhance task status (add: blocked, needs_review, ready_for_rollout, archived)
        6. Add cross-item integration metadata (related items, contract versions)

        Benefits: - Better plan_next intelligence (dependency resolution, effort estimation)
        - Automated validation (no missing dependencies, no circular deps) - Better
        progress tracking (granular status beyond pending/in_progress/done) - Future-proof
        for multi-agent coordination - System compatibility (structured data for tools/APIs)

        Implementation: - Create schemas in tools/wvo_mcp/src/roadmap/schemas.ts -
        Add roadmap validation script (scripts/validate_roadmap.ts) - Migrate existing
        roadmap.yaml to new structure (backwards compatible) - Update plan_next MCP

        \ source of truth, but build SQLite runtime index for fast queries. Best of\
        \ both worlds.\nProblem: YAML parsing is slow (~50ms for 500 tasks), no indexing,\
        \ no complex queries. But YAML is human-readable, git-friendly, and easy to\
        \ edit. SQLite is fast (<5ms queries), has indexes and SQL, but poor git diffs\
        \ and not human-editable.\nSolution: Hybrid approach - YAML as source, SQLite\
        \ as runtime index. On MCP server startup, load roadmap.yaml \u2192 build\
        \ SQLite database in memory or on disk. File watcher detects YAML changes\
        \ \u2192 reload SQLite. All queries use SQLite, all edits go through YAML.\n\
        Architecture: 1. Schema: SQLite tables (tasks, dependencies, exit_criteria,\
        \ metadata, tags) 2. Loader: YAML parser \u2192 populate SQLite (tools/wvo_mcp/src/roadmap/loader.ts)\
        \ 3. Query Interface: Replace direct YAML access with SQL queries 4. Hot Reload:\
        \ File watcher on state/roadmap.yaml \u2192 trigger reload 5. Validation:\
        \ Both YAML (structure) and SQLite (referential integrity)\nMigration Path:\
        \ - Phase 1: Build loader + SQLite schema (no breaking changes) - Phase 2:\
        \ Add parallel queries (YAML + SQLite, verify consistency) - Phase 3: Migrate\
        \ MCP tools to SQLite-only - Phase 4: Remove YAML parsing from query path\
        \ (keep for edits)\nBenefits: - Fast queries: O(1) lookups vs O(n) YAML scan\
        \ - Complex queries: SQL joins vs manual YAML traversal - Indexes: task_id,\
        \ status, dependencies, tags - Scalability: Handle 10,000+ tasks efficiently\
        \ - Git-friendly: YAML source of truth remains unchanged - Transactions: Atomic\
        \ updates to roadmap state\nExample Queries: - \"Find all ready tasks\" \u2192\
        \ SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status='ready' AND all_blockers_done=1 - \"Calculate\
        \ WSJF ranking\" \u2192 SELECT *, (readiness * value) / effort AS wsjf FROM\
        \ tasks ORDER BY wsjf DESC - \"Find blockers for task X\" \u2192 SELECT *\
        \ FROM dependencies WHERE dependent_id='X' AND type='depends_on'\nTrade-offs:\
        \ - Complexity: Two representations to keep in sync - Memory: SQLite database\
        \ (~2-5MB for 500 tasks) - Startup: Initial load takes ~100ms (vs ~50ms pure\
        \ YAML) - Benefit: Ongoing queries 10-100x faster\nFuture Extensions: - Vector\
        \ embeddings for task similarity search - Full-text search on descriptions\

        \ (both current and post-improvement) to identify gaps, redundancies, and\
        \ opportunities for enhancement. Consider evolving work processes and autopilot\
        \ capabilities to anticipate future tool needs.\nCurrent State Assessment:\
        \ 1. Inventory all MCP tools (wvo_status, plan_next, fs_read, cmd_run, etc.)\
        \ 2. Measure usage frequency and context (which workflows use which tools)\
        \ 3. Identify tool gaps (workflows that lack appropriate tools) 4. Analyze\
        \ tool redundancy (overlapping functionality) 5. Evaluate tool ergonomics\
        \ (ease of use, clarity, error handling)\nFuture State Analysis: 1. Map tools\
        \ to future autopilot capabilities (post AT-GUARD, post instrumentation) 2.\
        \ Identify tools needed for new workflows (meta-evaluation, self-improvement)\
        \ 3. Design tools for emerging patterns (e.g., quality graph queries, roadmap\
        \ intelligence) 4. Consider multi-agent coordination needs (locks, leases,\
        \ handoffs) 5. Evaluate cross-cutting concerns (observability, error recovery,\
        \ rollback)\nTool Categories to Evaluate: - State Management (plan_next, plan_update,\
        \ context_write) - File System (fs_read, fs_write) - Execution (cmd_run, heavy_queue_enqueue)\
        \ - Quality (critics_run, quality_checklist) - Meta (wvo_status, provider_status,\
        \ state_metrics) - Observability (screenshot_session, artifact_record) - LSP\
        \ (lsp_definition, lsp_references, lsp_hover) - Flags (mcp_admin_flags)\n\
        Outputs: 1. Tool Usage Matrix (tool \xD7 workflow \xD7 frequency) 2. Gap Analysis\
        \ Report (missing tools, priority ranking) 3. Tool Enhancement Proposals (5-10\
        \ high-priority improvements) 4. New Tool Specifications (3-5 critical gaps)\
        \ 5. Deprecation Recommendations (redundant/unused tools)\nMeta Consideration:\
        \ Roadmap structure improvements (ROADMAP-STRUCT) apply to both autopilot\
        \ and WeatherVane roadmaps. Tool evaluation should consider how roadmap enhancements\
        \ enable new tool capabilities (e.g., tools that query roadmap metadata, suggest\
        \ next tasks, estimate effort).\nBenefits: - More efficient autopilot workflows\
        \ (right tools for each job) - Better developer experience (ergonomic, discoverable\
        \ tools) - Reduced tool sprawl (consolidate redundant functionality) - Future-proofed\

        Identity: Regression Hunter (quality, authority blocking)

        Mission: Keep the test suites healthy and ensure deterministic results across
        flows.

        Signature powers: Surfaces flaky suites and failing assertions with reproduction
        notes.; Synthesizes minimal repro commands for Autopilot triage.

        Autonomy guidance: Rerun targeted suites automatically; lean on Autopilot
        only when new failures persist.


        No successful runs recorded in the last 6 observations; 6 consecutive failures
        detected.


        Observation window: 6 runs


        Consecutive failures: 6


        Failures: 6 | Successes: 0


        Assigned to: Director Dana


        Expectations:

        - Diagnose root causes for the critic''s repeated failures.

        - Patch critic configuration, training data, or underlying automation as needed.

        - Document findings in state/context.md and roadmap notes.

        - Close this task once the critic passes reliably.

        **ORIGINAL TASK**: [REM] Verify: Create ModelingReality critic with quantitative\
        \ thresholds\n\n**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:\n\n1. **Code Exists**:\n   - Locate\
        \ all files modified/created for task T-MLR-0.1\n   - Verify code is not empty,\
        \ stub, or placeholder\n   - Check for TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete\
        \ work\n\n2. **Tests Exist & Pass**:\n   - Find test files for task T-MLR-0.1\n\
        \   - Run tests: npm test or pytest (must ALL pass)\n   - Verify tests are\
        \ meaningful (check behavior, not just run code)\n   - Check test coverage\
        \ for new code (target: 80%+)\n\n3. **Build Passes**:\n   - Run build: npm\
        \ run build or python build.py (0 errors)\n   - Fix any TypeScript errors,\
        \ import errors, or syntax issues\n\n4. **Documentation Matches Code**:\n\
        \   - Read documentation for task T-MLR-0.1\n   - Verify every claimed feature\
        \ has actual implementation\n   - Check for lies: Features documented but\
        \ not implemented\n   - Update docs if implementation differs from claims\n\
        \n5. **Runtime Works**:\n   - Actually RUN the feature end-to-end with real\
        \ data\n   - Provide runtime evidence: screenshot/logs showing it working\n\
        \   - Test error cases: Does it fail gracefully?\n   - Check resource usage:\
        \ Memory leaks? CPU spikes?\n\n6. **Adversarial Checks**:\n   - Run adversarial_bullshit_detector\
        \ on task T-MLR-0.1\n   - Check for superficial completion (empty metrics,\
        \ unused infrastructure)\n   - Verify no test manipulation (tests changed\
        \ to pass without fixing bugs)\n   - Check for documentation-code mismatches\n\
        \n7. **Integration**:\n   - Is task T-MLR-0.1 actually integrated into the\
        \ system?\n   - Can you demonstrate it working in context?\n   - Are there\
        \ any dead code paths that never execute?\n\n**WHAT TO FIX IF ISSUES FOUND**:\n\
        - Missing code \u2192 Implement it\n- Failing tests \u2192 Fix the bugs OR\
        \ fix the tests (if tests are wrong)\n- Build errors \u2192 Fix compilation\
        \ issues\n- Doc mismatches \u2192 Update docs to match code OR implement missing\
        \ features\n- No runtime evidence \u2192 Actually run it and capture evidence\n\
        - Superficial completion \u2192 Do the real work\n\n**EXIT CRITERIA**:\n-\
        \ \u2705 Code exists and is complete\n- \u2705 All tests pass (100%)\n- \u2705\
        \ Build passes (0 errors)\n- \u2705 Documentation matches implementation\n\
        - \u2705 Runtime evidence provided (screenshot/logs)\n- \u2705 Adversarial\
        \ detector: APPROVED\n- \u2705 Integration verified (feature works in context)\n\
        - \u2705 No critical issues found\n\n**SEVERITY**: Task T-MLR-0.1 was marked\
        \ \"done\" but needs verification\n**PRIORITY**: Must verify before claiming\
        \ remediation complete\n\n**MANDATORY EVIDENCE COLLECTION** (for quality gates):\n\
        \n1. **BUILD Evidence**:\n   ```bash\n   cd /Volumes/BigSSD4/nathanielschmiedehaus/Documents/WeatherVane/tools/wvo_mcp\n\
        \   npm run build 2>&1\n   ```\n   - Capture FULL output\n   - Must show \"\
        0 errors\"\n   - Provide output in verification report\n\n2. **TEST Evidence**:\n\
        \   ```bash\n   npm test 2>&1\n   ```\n   - Capture FULL output\n   - Must\
        \ show \"X/X passing\" (all tests pass)\n   - Provide output in verification\
        \ report\n\n3. **AUDIT Evidence**:\n   ```bash\n   npm audit 2>&1\n   ```\n\
        \   - Capture FULL output\n   - Must show \"0 vulnerabilities\"\n   - Provide\
        \ output in verification report\n\n4. **RUNTIME Evidence** (at least ONE of):\n\
        \   - Screenshot of feature running in browser/CLI\n   - Log file from feature\
        \ execution\n   - Artifact created by feature (JSON file, report, etc.)\n\
        \   - Demonstration video/recording\n\n5. **DOCUMENTATION Evidence**:\n  \
        \ - List files modified/created\n   - Quote relevant documentation sections\n\
        \   - Verify docs match implementation\n\n**Quality Gate Checklist**:\n- [\

        \   - Check for TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete work\n\n2. **Tests\
        \ Exist & Pass**:\n   - Find test files for task T10.1.1\n   - Run tests:\
        \ npm test or pytest (must ALL pass)\n   - Verify tests are meaningful (check\
        \ behavior, not just run code)\n   - Check test coverage for new code (target:\
        \ 80%+)\n\n3. **Build Passes**:\n   - Run build: npm run build or python build.py\
        \ (0 errors)\n   - Fix any TypeScript errors, import errors, or syntax issues\n\
        \n4. **Documentation Matches Code**:\n   - Read documentation for task T10.1.1\n\
        \   - Verify every claimed feature has actual implementation\n   - Check for\
        \ lies: Features documented but not implemented\n   - Update docs if implementation\
        \ differs from claims\n\n5. **Runtime Works**:\n   - Actually RUN the feature\
        \ end-to-end with real data\n   - Provide runtime evidence: screenshot/logs\
        \ showing it working\n   - Test error cases: Does it fail gracefully?\n  \
        \ - Check resource usage: Memory leaks? CPU spikes?\n\n6. **Adversarial Checks**:\n\
        \   - Run adversarial_bullshit_detector on task T10.1.1\n   - Check for superficial\
        \ completion (empty metrics, unused infrastructure)\n   - Verify no test manipulation\

        \ TASK**: [REM] Verify: Autopilot loop end-to-end testing (full autonomous\
        \ cycle val\n\n**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:\n\n1. **Code Exists**:\n   - Locate\
        \ all files modified/created for task T6.3.3\n   - Verify code is not empty,\
        \ stub, or placeholder\n   - Check for TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete\
        \ work\n\n2. **Tests Exist & Pass**:\n   - Find test files for task T6.3.3\n\
        \   - Run tests: npm test or pytest (must ALL pass)\n   - Verify tests are\
        \ meaningful (check behavior, not just run code)\n   - Check test coverage\
        \ for new code (target: 80%+)\n\n3. **Build Passes**:\n   - Run build: npm\
        \ run build or python build.py (0 errors)\n   - Fix any TypeScript errors,\
        \ import errors, or syntax issues\n\n4. **Documentation Matches Code**:\n\
        \   - Read documentation for task T6.3.3\n   - Verify every claimed feature\
        \ has actual implementation\n   - Check for lies: Features documented but\
        \ not implemented\n   - Update docs if implementation differs from claims\n\
        \n5. **Runtime Works**:\n   - Actually RUN the feature end-to-end with real\
        \ data\n   - Provide runtime evidence: screenshot/logs showing it working\n\
        \   - Test error cases: Does it fail gracefully?\n   - Check resource usage:\
        \ Memory leaks? CPU spikes?\n\n6. **Adversarial Checks**:\n   - Run adversarial_bullshit_detector\
        \ on task T6.3.3\n   - Check for superficial completion (empty metrics, unused\
        \ infrastructure)\n   - Verify no test manipulation (tests changed to pass\
        \ without fixing bugs)\n   - Check for documentation-code mismatches\n\n7.\
        \ **Integration**:\n   - Is task T6.3.3 actually integrated into the system?\n\
        \   - Can you demonstrate it working in context?\n   - Are there any dead\
        \ code paths that never execute?\n\n**WHAT TO FIX IF ISSUES FOUND**:\n- Missing\
        \ code \u2192 Implement it\n- Failing tests \u2192 Fix the bugs OR fix the\
        \ tests (if tests are wrong)\n- Build errors \u2192 Fix compilation issues\n\
        - Doc mismatches \u2192 Update docs to match code OR implement missing features\n\

        - \u2705 Integration verified (feature works in context)\n- \u2705 No critical\
        \ issues found\n\n**SEVERITY**: Task T6.3.3 was marked \"done\" but needs\
        \ verification\n**PRIORITY**: Must verify before claiming remediation complete\n\

        \ TASK**: [REM] Verify: SQLite FTS5 index for code search (SAFE: new index)\n\
        \n**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:\n\n1. **Code Exists**:\n   - Locate all files\
        \ modified/created for task T9.4.1\n   - Verify code is not empty, stub, or\
        \ placeholder\n   - Check for TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete work\n\
        \n2. **Tests Exist & Pass**:\n   - Find test files for task T9.4.1\n   - Run\
        \ tests: npm test or pytest (must ALL pass)\n   - Verify tests are meaningful\
        \ (check behavior, not just run code)\n   - Check test coverage for new code\
        \ (target: 80%+)\n\n3. **Build Passes**:\n   - Run build: npm run build or\
        \ python build.py (0 errors)\n   - Fix any TypeScript errors, import errors,\
        \ or syntax issues\n\n4. **Documentation Matches Code**:\n   - Read documentation\
        \ for task T9.4.1\n   - Verify every claimed feature has actual implementation\n\
        \   - Check for lies: Features documented but not implemented\n   - Update\
        \ docs if implementation differs from claims\n\n5. **Runtime Works**:\n  \
        \ - Actually RUN the feature end-to-end with real data\n   - Provide runtime\
        \ evidence: screenshot/logs showing it working\n   - Test error cases: Does\
        \ it fail gracefully?\n   - Check resource usage: Memory leaks? CPU spikes?\n\
        \n6. **Adversarial Checks**:\n   - Run adversarial_bullshit_detector on task\
        \ T9.4.1\n   - Check for superficial completion (empty metrics, unused infrastructure)\n\
        \   - Verify no test manipulation (tests changed to pass without fixing bugs)\n\
        \   - Check for documentation-code mismatches\n\n7. **Integration**:\n   -\
        \ Is task T9.4.1 actually integrated into the system?\n   - Can you demonstrate\
        \ it working in context?\n   - Are there any dead code paths that never execute?\n\
        \n**WHAT TO FIX IF ISSUES FOUND**:\n- Missing code \u2192 Implement it\n-\
        \ Failing tests \u2192 Fix the bugs OR fix the tests (if tests are wrong)\n\
        - Build errors \u2192 Fix compilation issues\n- Doc mismatches \u2192 Update\
        \ docs to match code OR implement missing features\n- No runtime evidence\

      description: 'IMPORTANT: This is NOT about replacing document-based evidence.
        This is about AUGMENTING it with executable checks. The hypothesis: adding
        tests/scripts/metrics ON TOP of existing rigor will catch more issues and
        provide continuous verification without reducing thoughtfulness.

        Approach: Pick one medium-complexity task and execute it with BOTH: (1) All
        existing document-based evidence (strategy.md, spec.md, etc.) (2) NEW executable
        evidence (examples.test.ts, smoke_test.sh, metrics.ts, etc.)

        The goal is MORE rigor, not less. More verification, not less documentation.
        More continuous checking, not less upfront thinking.

        After pilot, measure: - Time overhead (is hybrid 2x slower? Acceptable?) -
        Effectiveness (does executable catch issues docs miss?) - Ongoing value (does
        evidence run in CI? Catch regressions?)

        Then decide: - ROLLOUT: Hybrid approach works, expand to all tasks - ITERATE:
        Mixed results, refine and re-pilot - ABANDON: Not worth overhead, keep document-only

        Deliverables: 1. Pilot task evidence (document + executable) 2. Templates
        for adding executable to each phase 3. Comparative metrics (time, effectiveness,
        value) 4. Decision doc with clear rationale 5. If ROLLOUT: Updated CLAUDE.md
        and WorkProcessEnforcer
