              CRITICAL FIX: Current autonomous runner bypasses ALL quality
              systems, creating fake completions in 0.5 seconds without doing
              any work. This task ELIMINATES ALL BYPASSES and enforces full AFP
              10-phase lifecycle, all 5 critics, all gates, all hooks, real
              evidence generation, testing, and proof of quality. No
              compromises. User explicitly demanded "highest order
              specifications of quality control" - we must deliver that, not
              fake completions. Blocks all other autopilot work until fixed.

              FOLLOW-UP TO AFP-W0-AUTOPILOT-INTEGRITY-ENFORCEMENT-20251107: The
              previous task eliminated code-level bypasses. This task prevents
              AGENT-LEVEL bypasses. User directive: "ensure agents themselves
              follow these standards...anything else that could be cheap or
              slick to get around quality standards not only gets blocked but
              can't happen in the first place." Focuses on behavioral
              enforcement: pre-commit checks, mid-execution validation,
              post-completion verification. Addresses the meta-problem: I took
              shortcuts while implementing bypass removal (only did STRATEGIZE,
              claimed done). This task ensures agents enforce quality on
              THEMSELVES, not just on the code they write. Evidence:

              Implement property-based testing using fast-check library. Test
              invariants rather than specific cases, generating hundreds of test
              cases automatically. Universal practice (model-agnostic). PARTIAL:
              Documentation added (285 lines in UNIVERSAL_TEST_STANDARDS.md).
              Remaining: Install fast-check, write property tests for roadmap
              mutation API to validate core invariants (cycles never created,
              dependencies always valid, rate limits enforced).

              rounds). Tools already available, just need workflow
              documentation.

      Ensures all tests run autonomously with perfect git hygiene and GitHub integration.
    acceptance:
      - Isolated test environment at /tmp/e2e_test_state
      - Test orchestrator manages Wave 0 instances
      - Operator monitor detects and fixes errors/loops

      - Automatic state reset between test runs
      - All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
      - Zero manual intervention required
      - Full E2E suite completes in < 10 minutes
      - 95%+ test success rate with auto-recovery
