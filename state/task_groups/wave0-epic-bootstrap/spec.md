# SPEC: wave0-epic-bootstrap

**Set ID:** wave0-epic-bootstrap
**Date:** 2025-11-06

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `state/epics/WAVE-0/strategy.md` exists and answers WHY WAVE-0
- [ ] `state/epics/WAVE-0/spec.md` exists with measurable outcomes
- [ ] `state/epics/WAVE-0/plan.md` exists with milestone integration
- [ ] `state/epics/WAVE-0/think.md` exists with risks/dependencies
- [ ] `state/epics/WAVE-0/design.md` exists with architecture patterns
- [ ] All docs pass OutcomeCritic review

---

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** Epic strategy.md must explain:
- Why foundation stabilization now
- What problem WAVE-0 solves
- How it aligns with project vision

**FR2:** Epic spec.md must define:
- Measurable outcomes (not vague "improve")
- Success metrics
- Exit criteria for WAVE-0

**FR3:** Epic plan.md must document:
- Milestones (W0.M1, W0.M2, W0.M3)
- Integration approach (how milestones connect)
- Sequencing/dependencies

**FR4:** Epic think.md must analyze:
- Epic-level risks (what could derail WAVE-0)
- Dependencies (external blockers)
- Failure modes

**FR5:** Epic design.md must specify:
- Architecture patterns (proof-driven, autonomous, hierarchical)
- Integration design
- Alternatives considered

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Depth**
- Each epic doc: 2-3 pages (not task-level 0.5 page)
- Substantial thinking, not checkbox

**NFR2: Measurability**
- Outcomes must be testable
- Metrics must be trackable
- No vague aspirations

**NFR3: Reusability**
- These docs become template for future epics
- Quality matters (will be copied)

---

## Out of Scope

- Project-level docs (separate task)
- META-level docs (separate task)
- Other epic docs (WAVE-1, WAVE-2, etc.) - retroactive, not priority

**Next:** plan.md (how to create docs)
