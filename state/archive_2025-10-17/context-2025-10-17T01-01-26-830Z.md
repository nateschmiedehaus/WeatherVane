## Current Focus
### WeatherVane MCP (domain: mcp)
- 2025-10-17T00:29Z: Restarted MCP via `./scripts/restart_mcp.sh`; `plan_next(mcp, minimal=true)` and `autopilot_status` still return “No active worker available.” `worker_health` previously showed the worker exiting moments after spawn, so Atlas remains blocked until Director Dana provides restoration guidance.

### WeatherVane Product (domain: product)
- 2025-10-17T00:29Z: Post-restart, `plan_next(product, minimal=true)`, `autopilot_status`, and `critics_run` (design_system, exec_review, integration_fury, manager_self_check, prompt_budget) all respond “No active worker available.” PRODUCT roadmap remains gated behind Dana’s worker restoration plan.
- 2025-10-16T23:21Z: `bash tools/wvo_mcp/scripts/run_integrity_tests.sh` completed (pytest + Vitest + metrics sweep) to refresh TestsCritic evidence ahead of product work.
- 2025-10-16T23:19Z: `critics_run` yielded passes for design_system, integration_fury, prompt_budget; exec_review capability-skipped; manager_self_check failed `git_clean` guardrail due to orchestrator/state artifacts. Await Dana’s direction on workspace sanitation before retrying.

### Orchestration & Guardrails
- Manager_self_check remains the gating failure: dirty workspace (tracked state files, sqlite artifacts, `.clean_worktree`) violates the `git_clean` preflight. Need Director Dana’s decision on either isolating automation artifacts, introducing an approved cleanup routine, or adjusting the guardrail before touching roadmap commitments.
- Exec_review critic still capability-gated; uplift path sits with Director Dana.

## Risks
- PRODUCT roadmap cannot advance until the git_clean guardrail is satisfied; bypassing it would break Autopilot safety policy.
- Repeated critic and integrity runs churn telemetry/cost budgets; monitor provider ceilings while iterating on guardrails.

## Next actions
- Coordinate with Director Dana on workspace sanitation or sanctioned guardrail override so manager_self_check can pass.
- Once resolved, rerun critics for manager_self_check (and exec_review if capabilities unblock) before picking up T3.3.x/T3.4.x slices.
- Keep state/task_memos and consensus records current to restart PRODUCT work as soon as critics stabilize.

## main

## Current Focus
- 2025-10-17T07:08Z: Atlas attempted `critics_run` (design_system, exec_review, integration_fury, manager_self_check, prompt_budget); call failed with MCP tool error. PRODUCT critics remain unavailable pending worker restoration.
- 2025-10-17T07:06Z: `plan_next(minimal=true)` and `autopilot_status` responded successfully after prior MCP restart; no active worker alert cleared, but critics still cannot execute.

## MCP & Guardrails
- Manager_self_check continues to block PRODUCT work; guardrail expects a clean git workspace before roadmap execution.
- Exec_review critic remains capability-gated until Director Dana enables it.
- Integrity suite last ran 2025-10-16T23:21Z via `bash tools/wvo_mcp/scripts/run_integrity_tests.sh`; no newer signal available while critics are offline.

## Risks
- T3.3.x/T3.4.x roadmap slices (hierarchical consensus, staffing telemetry, plan overview, WeatherOps dashboard) remain blocked until critic coverage returns.
- Repeated critic retries risk extra telemetry churn without coordination on worker stability.

## Next Actions
1. Coordinate with Director Dana on MCP worker restoration so PRODUCT critic suites can execute.
2. Once workers are stable, rerun the five PRODUCT critics before picking up roadmap tasks.
3. Maintain readiness to lift T3.3.2, T3.3.4, T3.4.1, T3.4.2 immediately after critic recovery.

- Restarted MCP via `scripts/restart_mcp.sh`, but Autopilot tools (`plan_next`, `autopilot_status`, `critics_run`) still report no active worker; need Director Dana guidance on restoration path.
- Awaiting instructions before proceeding with PRODUCT roadmap slices or further critic runs.
