# STRATEGY: WAVE-2 – Knowledge Base Deployment

**Epic ID:** WAVE-2
**Status:** Pending
**Date:** 2025-11-06
**Dependencies:** WAVE-0 (foundation), WAVE-1 (governance)

---

## Problem

With foundation (WAVE-0) and governance (WAVE-1) established, the next gap is **knowledge discoverability**.

Current pain: Distributed documentation (docs/, tools/, state/) hard to navigate. No README automation, no dependency diagrams, no first-time guides.

---

## Goal

**Automated knowledge base deployment:**
- README automation (generate/update READMEs)
- Dependency diagrams (visualize architecture)
- First-time contributor guides
- Manifest telemetry (track documentation health)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] READMEs auto-generated in all directories
- [ ] Dependency diagrams current
- [ ] First-time guides complete
- [ ] Documentation health >90%

---

**Milestones:**
- W2.M1: README Automation (9 tasks)
- W2.M2: Prompt Architecture (11 tasks)

**Estimated:** ~120 hours
