# Pre-Execution Quality Commitment

**Task:** AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-RESTORE-20251120  
**Agent:** Codex  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-20T14:06:32Z

## Quality Commitment

- [ ] I have read and understood the task requirements completely
- [ ] I have read docs/agent_self_enforcement_guide.md
- [ ] I have reviewed state/analytics/behavioral_patterns.json
- [ ] I commit to completing ALL 10 AFP phases (STRATEGIZE through MONITOR)
- [ ] I commit to quality over speed always
- [ ] I understand "done" means: All phases complete + All critics passed + Proof provided
- [ ] I will self-check at phase boundaries (10 times)
- [ ] I will remediate any failed self-checks before proceeding
- [ ] I will NOT claim done without post-execution validation
- [ ] I will avoid all "cheap or slick" workarounds documented in pattern library

## Understanding Check

**What does "done" mean for this task?**  
Autopilot V2 restore is done when all 10 AFP phases for this task are completed with approved critics (strategy/think/design/tests/process), Wave0/Proof runs are unblocked, integrity suite passes, and the code plus evidence are committed and pushed under the task ID with monitor PR artifacts.

**What are the key bypass patterns to avoid?**  
1. BP001 - Partial Phase Completion (must complete all 10 phases)  
2. BP002 - Template Evidence (no boilerplate fillers; real reasoning)  
3. BP003 - Speed Over Quality (no rushing past critics or gates)  

**Commitment Statement:**  
I will follow the full AFP/SCAS lifecycle for AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-RESTORE-20251120, prioritize quality over speed, avoid all bypass patterns, and produce comprehensive evidence before claiming completion.
