## Legacy Verification Summary

Integrity and review audit fixes landed prior to the current evidence schema. Verification succeeded at the time (see integrity harness history) but artifacts were not captured. No new changes have touched this area since.

_Action_: Future updates must record fresh verify logs (audit runner output) to supersede this placeholder.
