# Self-Review

- Confirmed repository stays within AFP guardrails: docs + evidence updates only, and Wave 0 run reused existing runner logic (no code deltas required).
- Execution metadata now demonstrably exists for both autopilot and manual paths; daily checklist + reviewer workflow doc reference the CLI so agents cannot miss the step.
- Residual risk: Wave 0 blocked the selected task due to missing plan.md, which surfaced the intended discovery flow; follow-up belongs with that roadmap entry, not this tagging task.
