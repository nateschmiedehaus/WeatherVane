*Auto-generated by Wave 0 on 2025-11-06T23:01:10.757Z*

## Work Plan
1. Wave 0 autopilot executes the placeholder implementation step to capture repository state.
2. ProofSystem runs default build + test checks inside `tools/wvo_mcp`.

## Proof Criteria
- Build Verification: `npm run build`
- Test Verification: `npm run test`

## Verification Strategy
- Use ProofSystem output (`verify.md`) as canonical evidence.
- Review summary + review/monitor files for final notes.
