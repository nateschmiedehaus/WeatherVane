# Pre-Execution Quality Commitment

**Task:** AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-MODEL-SCOUT-20251120  
**Agent:** Codex  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-20T02:36:00Z

## Quality Commitment
- [x] I have read and understood the task requirements completely
- [x] I have read docs/agent_self_enforcement_guide.md
- [x] I have reviewed state/analytics/behavioral_patterns.json
- [x] I commit to completing ALL 10 AFP phases (STRATEGIZE through MONITOR)
- [x] I commit to quality over speed always
- [x] I understand "done" means: All phases complete + All critics passed + Proof provided
- [x] I will self-check at phase boundaries (10 times)
- [x] I will remediate any failed self-checks before proceeding
- [x] I will NOT claim done without post-execution validation
- [x] I will avoid all "cheap or slick" workarounds documented in the pattern library

## Understanding Check
**What does "done" mean for this task?**  
Model Scout automation built to keep ARCHITECTURE_V2 model routing current: periodic discovery of latest Gemini/Claude/Codex/o-series models, dynamic registry updates, tests/guardrails pass, evidence recorded, branch committed/pushed.

**Key bypass patterns to avoid?**  
1) BP001 Partial Phase Completion  
2) BP004 Skipping Self-Checks  
3) BP005 Claiming Without Proof

**Commitment Statement:**  
I will follow the full AFP lifecycle and deliver a long-term Scout solution (not static lists) with complete evidence and critics.
