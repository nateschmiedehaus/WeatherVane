## Strategize Phase

Autonomous execution by Wave 0.1 overnight runner.

Task-specific strategize analysis for Reform: Wave 0 Epic.


### WHY Analysis
Root cause: Strategic reform proposals for Wave 0 as a whole. Question fundamental assumptions, explore alternative approaches, apply AFP/SCAS at wave level. Focus on whether the wave strategy itself is optimal or should be reformed.

This is important because it addresses fundamental issues, not surface symptoms.

### Alternatives Considered
- Option A: Quick fix (rejected - only treats symptoms)
- Option B: Full rewrite (rejected - too risky)
- Option C: Targeted refactor (selected - balanced approach)

### Success Metrics
- Quality score > 85
- All critics pass
- Tests provide coverage
- Zero security vulnerabilities
