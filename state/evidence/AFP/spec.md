# SPEC - AFP (Meta)

**Created:** 2025-11-20  
**Phase:** SPEC  
**Author:** Codex

## Acceptance Criteria (Must)
- Core AFP meta artifacts exist and stay current: strategy/spec/plan/think/design captured under `state/evidence/AFP/`.
- Summarize lifecycle guardrails and expectations (10 phases, critics, guardrails, hygiene).
- Document success metrics for AFP adoption (100% tasks with full evidence, guardrail green, no bypass patterns).

## Acceptance Criteria (Should)
- Note live checks (daily audit, guardrail monitor, wave0) as standard verification inputs.
- Identify remediation workflow for bypass patterns (BP001–BP005).

## Acceptance Criteria (Could)
- Capture periodic review cadence for AFP templates and critics.

## Functional Requirements
- FR1: Evidence files outline intent, plan, risks, and design for AFP governance.
- FR2: Defines success criteria and verification checkpoints reusable by downstream tasks.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Be concise (<2 pages per artifact) and high-signal.
- No new dependencies or tooling changes required.
