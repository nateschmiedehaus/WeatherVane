# MONITOR Plan (IMP-22)

- Track persona hash telemetry once feature flag enabled (ensure counters/logs present).
- During integration, verify `state/process/prompt_baseline_updates.jsonl` includes persona metadata when hashes change.
- Coordinate with observability to update dashboards once telemetry fields appear.

## Delta Notes

- 2025-10-29T19:45:00Z — Policy — Any residual follow-up requirements discovered during the task must be promoted to explicit roadmap tasks (no informal TODOs). Owner: codex (complete).
