# MONITOR - AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-MODEL-SCOUT-LIVE-20251120

**Date:** 2025-11-20  
**Status:** Monitoring notes

## Follow-ups
- Integrate real provider fetch/benchmarks (current run uses cached/stubs if no source provided).
- External dirty files remain (.worktrees/pr21, analytics/provider_capacity_metrics.json, limits/usage_log.json, followups.md); coordinate cleanup with owners.

## Evidence
- Guardrail monitor pass.
- Wave0 dry-run: stale locks removed; clean exit with no tasks.
