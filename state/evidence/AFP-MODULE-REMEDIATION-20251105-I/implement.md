# Implementation Notes

- Captured TypeScript diagnostics via `npx tsc --noEmit -p tools/wvo_mcp/tsconfig.json` and stored output in `tsc-errors.log`.
- Reviewed affected modules/tests to assess intent and feasibility of deletion vs. adaptation.
- Authored remediation catalog (`analysis.md`) summarising recommended actions and proposed follow-up task IDs (J–N).
- Updated follow-up tracker with new tasks and current status for task I.
