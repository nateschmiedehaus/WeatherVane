# REVIEW — Notes
- Verified CLAUDE.md, tools README, WORK_PROCESS.md, and QUALITY_INTEGRATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md include autonomy framing, baseline instrumentation workflow, parity/capability cadence, and escalation triggers.
- Cross-links confirmed between docs and Phase 0 instrumentation contract; command tables reference actual script names and evidence paths.
- Outstanding work limited to observer prompt refresh (tracked in IMPLEMENT notes).
