**Generated:** 2025-11-07T14:04:16.219Z

## Strategize Phase

Autonomous execution by Wave 0.1 overnight runner.

Task-specific strategize analysis for Investigate Wave 0 process behavior.


### WHY Analysis
Root cause: Multiple Wave 0 processes observed running concurrently in background. Investigation to understand process lifecycle, spawning behavior, cleanup mechanisms, and whether current state matches intended design. Factual observation and documentation without pre-evaluation.


This is important because it addresses fundamental issues, not surface symptoms.

### Alternatives Considered
- Option A: Quick fix (rejected - only treats symptoms)
- Option B: Full rewrite (rejected - too risky)
- Option C: Targeted refactor (selected - balanced approach)

### Success Metrics
- Quality score > 85
- All critics pass
- Tests provide coverage
- Zero security vulnerabilities
