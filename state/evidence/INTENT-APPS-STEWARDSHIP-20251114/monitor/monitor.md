# Monitor — INTENT-APPS-STEWARDSHIP-20251114

- Steward manifests added for `apps/`, `docs/`, `shared/`, and `state/`.
- Guardrail CI (`guardrails` workflow) should now only flag missing stewardship once other modules are covered; monitor PR for green run.
- Next follow-ups: ensure teams adopt review cadence and populate module signals with telemetry.
