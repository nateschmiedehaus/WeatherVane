# Self-Review

- Touched guardrail tests, work-process fixtures, reviewer pipeline, ML aggregator, knowledge extractor/storage, plus docs/wave0 evidence; LOC delta ~130 and stays under the guardrail.
- Verified every suite that previously blocked ProofSystem + the full `npm run test` bundle before rerunning Wave 0.
- Wave 0 proof log shows “Proven” status (no test/build failures), satisfying the task goal of unblocking autopilot.
- Follow-up backlog updated (tasks Q/R/S/T/U still pending) so future remediation work stays tracked.
