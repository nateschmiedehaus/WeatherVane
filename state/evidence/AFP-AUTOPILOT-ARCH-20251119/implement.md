# IMPLEMENT - AFP-AUTOPILOT-ARCH-20251119

**Phase window:** 2025-11-19  
**Status:** Complete (doc authored; verification logged in VERIFY)

## Changes Made
- Authored `docs/orchestration/autopilot_afp_alignment.md` mapping AFP phases to automated agents/tools with gap/actions, rollout path, and verification hooks.
- Updated `state/context.md` with a concise note about the new alignment doc and audit/guardrail follow-up.
- Added evidence artifacts: phases.md summary and mid-execution logs; maintained adherence to file/LOC constraints (non-evidence files: new doc + context update).

## Notes
- No code logic changed; scope limited to documentation and evidence.
- Verification (integrity suite, guardrail monitor rerun) will be executed in VERIFY phase.
