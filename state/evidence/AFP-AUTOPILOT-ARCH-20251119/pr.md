# PR - AFP-AUTOPILOT-ARCH-20251119

**Status:** Not opened

## Plan
- Stage only task files (docs/orchestration/autopilot_afp_alignment.md, state/context.md, evidence for this task).
- Craft commit message with pattern tag: `orchestration: add autopilot afp alignment doc (AFP-AUTOPILOT-ARCH-20251119)`.
- Push branch and open PR using standard template, highlighting integrity test failures as pre-existing.

## Blockers
- Repository currently dirty with extensive unrelated changes (multiple apps/model, tools/wvo_mcp, evidence). Creating a clean PR requires coordination to avoid mixing work.

## Next Actions
- Once workspace is clean or branch isolated, stage and open PR per plan above.
