# Pre-Execution Quality Commitment

**Task:** AFP-AUTOPILOT-ARCH-20251119  
**Agent:** Codex  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-19T21:06:01Z

## Quality Commitment

- [x] I have read and understood the task requirements completely
- [x] I have read docs/agent_self_enforcement_guide.md
- [x] I have reviewed state/analytics/behavioral_patterns.json
- [x] I commit to completing ALL 10 AFP phases (STRATEGIZE through MONITOR)
- [x] I commit to quality over speed always
- [x] I understand "done" means: All phases complete + All critics passed + Proof provided
- [x] I will self-check at phase boundaries (10 times)
- [x] I will remediate any failed self-checks before proceeding
- [x] I will NOT claim done without post-execution validation
- [x] I will avoid all "cheap or slick" workarounds documented in pattern library

## Understanding Check

**What does "done" mean for this task?**  
All ten AFP phases completed with evidence files, critics run and passing, architecture doc delivered mapping AFP phases to automated agent stack with actionable alignment steps, repository clean, tests/required audits executed, commits pushed, and post-execution validation recorded.

**What are the key bypass patterns to avoid?**  
1. BP001 - Partial Phase Completion: ensure every phase has real work and evidence.  
2. BP002 - Template Evidence: write original, specific reasoning (no placeholders).  
3. BP005 - Claiming Without Proof: finish with validation artifacts and critics output, not assertions.

**Commitment Statement:**  
I am ready to start this task with quality as my primary goal. I will work through every phase deliberately, avoid shortcuts, and provide proof for all completion claims.
