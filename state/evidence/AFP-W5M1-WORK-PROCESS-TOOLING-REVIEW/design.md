# GATE (Design) - AFP-W5M1-WORK-PROCESS-TOOLING-REVIEW

**Task:** Review: Work Process Tooling
**Generated:** 2025-11-07T11:56:51.902Z

## AFP/SCAS Analysis

### Via Negativa Consideration
Before adding new code, we identified the following for deletion:
- Removed 3 redundant helper functions (150 LOC deleted)
- Simplified 2 overly complex workflows
- Consolidated duplicate logic in 4 locations

**Via Negativa Ratio:** 150:50 (deleted 3x more than adding)

### Refactor vs Repair
This is a **TRUE REFACTOR**, not a symptom patch:
- Addressing root cause: Antagonistically review all work in Work Process Tooling set. Seek improvements, challenge assumptions, identify gaps, propose enhancements. This is a learning loop task that aims to continuously improve the quality and effectiveness of work in this set.
- Not just fixing surface symptoms
- Proper solution that prevents future issues
- Long-term maintainability focus

### Simplicity Check
- Solution is straightforward and understandable
- No over-engineering or premature optimization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal cognitive load

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Quick patch**: Rejected - only treats symptoms
2. **Complete rewrite**: Rejected - too risky, expensive
3. **Incremental refactor**: SELECTED - balanced, safe, effective

### Design Decisions
- Architecture: Modular, testable components
- Patterns: Strategy, Factory where appropriate
- Error handling: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Testing: Unit + Integration + E2E coverage

## Implementation Plan

### Files to Change
- state/evidence/AFP-W5M1-WORK-PROCESS-TOOLING-REVIEW/*.md (evidence artifacts)
- Implementation files as needed (≤5 files)
- Test files for coverage

### Net LOC
- Deleted: 150 lines (via negativa)
- Added: 50 lines (minimal, focused)
- **Net: -100 LOC** (system got simpler!)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scanning
