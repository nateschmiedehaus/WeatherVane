# Pre-Execution Quality Commitment

**Task:** AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-MODEL-20251120
**Agent:** Codex
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-20T01:25:16Z

## Quality Commitment
- [x] I have read and understood the task requirements completely
- [x] I have read docs/agent_self_enforcement_guide.md
- [x] I have reviewed state/analytics/behavioral_patterns.json
- [x] I commit to completing ALL 10 AFP phases (STRATEGIZE through MONITOR)
- [x] I commit to quality over speed always
- [x] I understand "done" means: All phases complete + All critics passed + Proof provided
- [x] I will self-check at phase boundaries (10 times)
- [x] I will remediate any failed self-checks before proceeding
- [x] I will NOT claim done without post-execution validation
- [x] I will avoid all "cheap or slick" workarounds documented in pattern library

## Understanding Check
**What does "done" mean for this task?**
Model Intelligence implemented per ARCHITECTURE_V2 (lanes Fast/Standard/Deep for latest models Gemini 3 / Claude 3.5 / o3), registry + lane selection wired, tests authored/run, critics passed, evidence stored, branch committed/pushed.

**What are the key bypass patterns to avoid?**
BP001 partial phases, BP004 skipping self-checks, BP005 claiming without proof.

**Commitment Statement:**
I will execute the full AFP lifecycle with complete evidence and verification, avoiding shortcuts.
