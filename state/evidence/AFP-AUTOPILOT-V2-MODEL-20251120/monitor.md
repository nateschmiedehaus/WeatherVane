# MONITOR - AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-MODEL-20251120

## Follow-ups
- Wave0 dry-run blocked by `.wave0.lock`; do not delete. Plan controlled restart if needed.
- commit:check shows repo dirtiness (external files: .worktrees/pr21, analytics/critics logs, overrides, roadmap, evidence followups). Coordinate with owners before cleanup.
- Seeds are placeholders; schedule weekly Scout to ingest real latest models/benchmarks and update capability tags/costs per ARCHITECTURE_V2.

## Actions Taken
- Fresh daily audit AFP-ARTIFACT-AUDIT-20251120; guardrail monitor passing.
- All critics (strategy/design/thinking) approved for this task.
- Branch pushed: feature/AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-MODEL-20251120.

## Alignment Check to ARCHITECTURE_V2
- Model Intelligence implemented: capability-tagged registry across providers, lane scoring, Scout merge hook per architecture goals.
- Remaining architecture items to tackle next: Immune/Git wiring, Membrane HUD, Legacy Cleanup/Grim Reaper, Execution graph gates.
