# Review: AFP-MODULE-REMEDIATION-20251105-B

- Restored `research_types.ts` with cohesive type definitions, ensuring intelligence modules share a consistent contract without exceeding guardrails (68 LOC).
- Extended pattern insight/alternative option shapes to match orchestrator expectations.
- Remaining TypeScript failures stem from other missing modules (`feature_gates`, `auth_checker`, `command_runner`) to be addressed in subsequent subtasks.
