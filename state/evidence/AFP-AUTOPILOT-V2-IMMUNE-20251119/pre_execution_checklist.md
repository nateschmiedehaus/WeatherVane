# Pre-Execution Quality Commitment

**Task:** AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-IMMUNE-20251119  
**Agent:** Codex  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-19T22:47:16Z

## Quality Commitment

- [x] I have read and understood the task requirements completely
- [x] I have read docs/agent_self_enforcement_guide.md
- [x] I have reviewed state/analytics/behavioral_patterns.json
- [x] I commit to completing ALL 10 AFP phases (STRATEGIZE through MONITOR)
- [x] I commit to quality over speed always
- [x] I understand "done" means: All phases complete + All critics passed + Proof provided
- [x] I will self-check at phase boundaries (10 times)
- [x] I will remediate any failed self-checks before proceeding
- [x] I will NOT claim done without post-execution validation
- [x] I will avoid all "cheap or slick" workarounds documented in pattern library

## Understanding Check

**What does "done" mean for this task?**  
All 10 AFP phases completed with evidence in `state/evidence/AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-IMMUNE-20251119/`, DesignReviewer/StrategyReviewer/ThinkingCritic (and other critics) approvals recorded, Phase 4 Immune System code and docs implemented per ARCHITECTURE_V2 with SCAS characteristics integrated, authored tests created in PLAN and executed in VERIFY, git commit and push completed.

**What are the key bypass patterns to avoid?**  
1. BP001 - Partial Phase Completion (skipping phases or evidence)  
2. BP004 - Skipping Self-Checks (missing mid_execution_checks)  
3. BP005 - Claiming Without Proof (no post-execution validation)

**Commitment Statement:**  
I will execute this task with quality as the priority, following the full AFP lifecycle and producing proof for every requirement.
