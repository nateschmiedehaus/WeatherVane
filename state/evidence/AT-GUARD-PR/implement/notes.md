- Authored PR summary (`pr/summary.md`) covering motivation, guardrail changes, verification, and monitoring commitments.
- Compiled evidence references for guardrail tasks (AT-GUARD-TS-LOADER-GATE, AT-GUARD-ZERO-BACKLOG, META-GUARD-SELF-CORRECT) plus automation artifacts.
- No code changes introduced; documentation-only update consolidating existing artifacts.
