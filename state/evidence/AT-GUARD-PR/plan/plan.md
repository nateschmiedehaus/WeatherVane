## Plan
1. Collect key artifacts/commands from guardrail remediation loop (workflow diff, scripts, automation outputs, evidence directories).
2. Draft PR summary skeleton covering Motivation → Changes → Verification → Monitoring.
3. Populate work-process phase notes (think/implement/verify/review/monitor) with concise findings.
4. Run `node tools/wvo_mcp/scripts/check_work_process_artifacts.mjs --task AT-GUARD-PR` after populating evidence to confirm completeness.
5. Final review for clarity and references, then stage summary for inclusion in final PR.
