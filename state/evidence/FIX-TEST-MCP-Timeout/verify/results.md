## Legacy Verification Summary

This task predates the enforced STRATEGIZE→MONITOR evidence flow. Verification was performed before evidence folders were required; no additional work has been executed since the guardrail migration.

_Gap Note_: When this area is revisited, capture fresh verification artifacts (pytest logs, MCP tool output) and replace this legacy note.
