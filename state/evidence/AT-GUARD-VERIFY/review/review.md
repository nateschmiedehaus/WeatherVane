# Review

- Integrity script executed; captured full log and audit JSONs.
- Highlighted blocking failures (MCP tooling timeout, roadmap evidence gaps, autopilot vitest baseline issues) and confirmed WorkProcessEnforcer-specific suites now pass after fixes.
- Telemetry outputs verified via targeted vitest runs and `oracle_coverage` re-check.
- Follow-ups listed in verification notes; require roadmap coordination before enforcing strict mode.
