# Pre-Execution Quality Commitment

**Task:** AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-IMMUNE-REMEDIATION-20251119  
**Agent:** Codex  
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-19T23:16:09Z

## Quality Commitment

- [x] I have read and understood the task requirements completely
- [x] I have read docs/agent_self_enforcement_guide.md
- [x] I have reviewed state/analytics/behavioral_patterns.json
- [x] I commit to completing ALL 10 AFP phases (STRATEGIZE through MONITOR)
- [x] I commit to quality over speed always
- [x] I understand "done" means: All phases complete + All critics passed + Proof provided
- [x] I will self-check at phase boundaries (10 times)
- [x] I will remediate any failed self-checks before proceeding
- [x] I will NOT claim done without post-execution validation
- [x] I will avoid all "cheap or slick" workarounds documented in pattern library

## Understanding Check

**What does "done" mean for this task?**  
All remediation items resolved: missing modules restored and passing build/test; wave0 dry-run unblocked; daily artifact audit refreshed; doc-check hook fixed; guardrail monitor rerun; repo hygiene issues addressed or coordinated; full AFP evidence and critics approvals recorded; commit/push on feature branch.

**What are the key bypass patterns to avoid?**  
1. BP001 Partial Phase Completion  
2. BP004 Skipping Self-Checks  
3. BP005 Claiming Without Proof

**Commitment Statement:**  
I will follow the full AFP lifecycle with comprehensive evidence and resolve upstream failures rather than bypassing them.
