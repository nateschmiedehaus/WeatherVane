# Self-Review

- Change spans 3 files, net LOC roughly neutral; all updates confined to orchestrator/browser test domain.
- Shared stub covers entire `FeatureGatesReader`; future interface changes now require edits in one file.
- Verified TypeScript output to ensure feature-gate errors cleared; remaining diagnostics recorded for subsequent tasks.
