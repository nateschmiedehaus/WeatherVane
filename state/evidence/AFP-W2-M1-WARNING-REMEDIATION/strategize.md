## Strategize Phase

Autonomous execution by Wave 0.1 overnight runner.

Task-specific strategize analysis for README warning remediation queue.


### WHY Analysis
Root cause: Stand up a repeatable process to drain high-severity README warnings captured by docsync, converting them into actionable roadmap items and tracking burn-down metrics.


This is important because it addresses fundamental issues, not surface symptoms.

### Alternatives Considered
- Option A: Quick fix (rejected - only treats symptoms)
- Option B: Full rewrite (rejected - too risky)
- Option C: Targeted refactor (selected - balanced approach)

### Success Metrics
- Quality score > 85
- All critics pass
- Tests provide coverage
- Zero security vulnerabilities
