task_id: AFP-GATE-TEST-REVIEW-SEVENLENS-20251105
complexity: simple
date: 2025-11-05

## Compliance Metrics

design_md_created: true
design_md_lines: 597
sections_filled: 7/7
all_sections_complete: true
specifics_present: true  # file:line references (lines 114-120, 66, etc.)
ran_design_reviewer: true
used_npm_command: true

## Quality Metrics

via_negativa_explored: true
via_negativa_outcome: "Net -10 LOC (config +80, loader +30, removed -120)"
alternatives_count: 3
alternatives_documented:
  - "Alternative 1: Config only (selected)"
  - "Alternative 2: Full refactor"
  - "Alternative 3: Two-phase approach"

refactor_vs_repair: "refactor"  # Fixing root cause (config in code)
complexity_justified: true
scope_estimated: true
files_to_change: 2
estimated_loc: -10  # Net deletion!

## Effectiveness Metrics

design_reviewer_result: "approved"
first_try_pass: true  # ✅ No remediation needed!
concerns_count: 1
concerns_severity:
  high: 1  # fake_file_references (but justified - file to be created)
  medium: 0
  low: 0

strengths_count: 6
strengths:
  - "Considered via negativa (deletion/simplification)"
  - "Considered refactoring approach (not just patching)"
  - "Explored 13+ alternative approaches"
  - "Analyzed complexity trade-offs"
  - "Estimated implementation scope"
  - "Considered risks and edge cases"

concerns_actionable: true
concern_detail: "File tools/wvo_mcp/config/lens_keywords.json doesn't exist - correct, planning to CREATE it"
false_positive: true  # File doesn't exist because we'll create it

remediation_cycles: 0  # Passed first try
remediation_tasks_created: 0

## Usability Metrics

gate_start_time: "2025-11-05T15:00:00Z"  # Approximate
gate_end_time: "2025-11-05T15:36:29Z"
gate_time_minutes: 36  # Design creation + review
gate_time_breakdown:
  design_creation: 30
  running_reviewer: 1
  analyzing_results: 5

confusion_incidents: []
helpful_aspects:
  - "Template structure clear"
  - "Task brief provided specific file:line references"
  - "Alternatives forced thorough thinking"
  - "Via negativa section revealed net deletion opportunity"
  - "DesignReviewer gave specific feedback on concerns"

pain_points:
  - "DesignReviewer flagged config file that doesn't exist yet (will be created)"
  - "High severity concern for planned file creation seems harsh"

suggestions:
  - "DesignReviewer could distinguish 'file to be created' vs 'referenced file missing'"
  - "Template could have section for 'Files to CREATE' vs 'Files to MODIFY'"

## Implementation Metrics (Not Yet Executed)

implementation_started: false
implementation_time_minutes: null
implementation_matches_design: null
tests_written: null
tests_passing: null
actual_loc: null

## Overall Assessment

gate_experience: "positive"
gate_value: "high"  # Forced thorough alternatives analysis, revealed net deletion
would_skip_gate: false
gate_overhead_acceptable: true  # 36 min for 2-3 hour task = 18-24% overhead

key_insights:
  - "Via negativa analysis revealed -10 net LOC (not obvious until analyzed)"
  - "Alternatives comparison prevented over-engineering (didn't add caching prematurely)"
  - "First-try approval shows design was thorough enough"
  - "High-severity concern about non-existent file is false positive (creating it)"

recommendations:
  - "Proceed with implementation as designed"
  - "DesignReviewer improvement: detect 'NEW' file markers in design"
  - "This validates GATE for simple tasks - continue to Task 2"
