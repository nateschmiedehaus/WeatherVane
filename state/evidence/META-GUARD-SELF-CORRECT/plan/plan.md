## Plan
1. Draft documentation edits for Work Process and Toolbox referencing loader guard + zero-deferral requirement.
2. Review existing meta guidance (META-GUARD-COMPLETE) to avoid contradictions.
3. Capture THINK notes summarizing doc diffs and governance impact.
4. Update VERIFY/REVIEW evidence once docs committed.
