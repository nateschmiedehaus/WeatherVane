## Spec: Policy + tooling refresh

### Deliverables
- Update `docs/autopilot/WORK_PROCESS.md` Guardrail Completion section with explicit loader guard instructions.
- Extend `docs/autopilot/TOOLBOX.md` to list the new guard command under a guardrail enforcement heading.
- Record evidence through full STRATEGIZE→MONITOR documentation.

### Acceptance
- Documentation builds (markdown lint) implicitly satisfied; manual review ensures clarity.
- Verify evidence includes references to updated docs.
