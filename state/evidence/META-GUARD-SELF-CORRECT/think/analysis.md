## Analysis
- Work Process already stresses zero-deferral broadly; adding loader guard call-out prevents ambiguity about guard categories.
- Toolbox lacked a guardrail catalog; introducing a dedicated section keeps future guards centralised.
- No additional automation needed yet, but doc updates must reference where the guard runs (CI + integrity harness).
