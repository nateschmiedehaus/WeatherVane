## Strategy: Embed no-deferral enforcement

### Motivation
- Guardrail regressions slipped through because policy documents did not explicitly call out loader guard checks and consolidated enforcement outputs.
- Work Process instructions must reference the new guard so future tasks cannot claim ignorance.

### Desired outcome
- Work-process handbook enumerates the loader guard as mandatory during VERIFY.
- Tooling index highlights the command to keep operators aligned.
- Evidence ensures audit trail for governance.
