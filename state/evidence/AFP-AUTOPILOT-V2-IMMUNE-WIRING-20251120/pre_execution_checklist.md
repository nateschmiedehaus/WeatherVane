# Pre-Execution Quality Commitment

**Task:** AFP-AUTOPILOT-V2-IMMUNE-WIRING-20251120
**Agent:** Codex
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-20T02:02:17Z

## Quality Commitment
- [x] Read and understood requirements
- [x] Read docs/agent_self_enforcement_guide.md
- [x] Reviewed state/analytics/behavioral_patterns.json
- [x] Commit to completing all 10 AFP phases
- [x] Quality over speed
- [x] Understand “done”: all phases + critics + proof
- [x] Self-check at phase boundaries
- [x] Remediate failed checks before proceeding
- [x] No claiming done without validation
- [x] Avoid bypass patterns (BP001-005)

## Understanding Check
**Done =** Immune wiring aligned to ARCHITECTURE_V2: Gatekeeper enforcement integrated (branch/commit/CI), docs updated if needed, tests executed, critics/guardrail/audit passing, commit/push on feature branch.

**Bypasses to avoid:** partial phases, skipping critics/guardrails, superficial evidence.
