## Strategize Phase

Autonomous execution by Wave 0.1 overnight runner.

Task-specific strategize analysis for Dynamic Prompt System build.


### WHY Analysis
Root cause: Rebuild the Dynamic Prompt System once supervisor + agents scaffolds exist so Autopilot can reason with updated templates.


This is important because it addresses fundamental issues, not surface symptoms.

### Alternatives Considered
- Option A: Quick fix (rejected - only treats symptoms)
- Option B: Full rewrite (rejected - too risky)
- Option C: Targeted refactor (selected - balanced approach)

### Success Metrics
- Quality score > 85
- All critics pass
- Tests provide coverage
- Zero security vulnerabilities
