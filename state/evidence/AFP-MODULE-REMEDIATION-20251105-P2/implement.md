# Implementation Notes

- Updated daily artifact checklist to require running `npm run spec:review` and `npm run plan:review` for tasks approaching the gate.
- Re-ran the full `tools/wvo_mcp` test suite; captured baseline failures (device_profile memory leak, domain expert reviewer templates) for follow-up.
- Documented reviewer command flow and log locations in the AFP lifecycle and autopilot validation docs.
