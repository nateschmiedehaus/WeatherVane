Based on my analysis of the current WeatherVane state, I can now provide the strategic evaluation:

## Key Insights

**The Good:** WeatherVane has strong foundations—design system tokens are well-structured, a11y is baked in, security audit is fresh (0a815522), and batch queue (T9.1.2) demonstrates solid execution velocity.

**The Gap:** Three parallel roadmaps (STATUS.md product delivery, roadmap.yaml E12 validation, ESSENTIAL_ONLY orchestrator optimization) create confusion. The orchestrator is underperforming targets (2 vs 10 tasks/day, $12 vs $5/day) but ESSENTIAL_ONLY's 7 critical fixes aren't implemented.

**The Risk:** ML task completion claims (T-MLR-2.2-2.5) lack corresponding artifacts. Either the tasks aren't actually done, or the artifacts are misplaced. This threatens E12 demo credibility.

**The Opportunity:** Implementing Model Router + WIP Limits (Week 1 of ESSENTIAL_ONLY) would unlock 60% cost reduction and enable the budget for everything else. This is the highest-leverage move available.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Atlas should focus on (1) Model Router implementation, (2) ML artifact verification, (3) Phase 0/1 product delivery. Defer orchestrator enhancements beyond Model Router until product milestones stabilize.
